Congratulations! At this point, you should now be ready to demonstrate some of the many values of IBM Cloud Satellite to clients. 

To complete the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge, do one of the following:

- **IBM employees:**
  
    Return the the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 learning plan in YourLearning and mark the IBM Cloud Satellite Demonstration Guide activity complete. Next, review the Stand and Deliver evaluation checklist. The checklist provides the evaluation criteria managers will use when reviewing your Stand and Deliver. And then, once you have practiced and are ready, record your Stand and Deliver video and submit it for review. Upon a positive review by management (or designated individuals), you will have completed the requirements for the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge. 

- **Business Partners:**
    
    Return the the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 learning plan in IBM Training Digital Learning Platform (learn.ibm.com) and mark the IBM Cloud Satellite Demonstration Guide activity complete. Next, you must take a very short, 5 question quiz regarding the activity just completed. Upon passing the quiz, you will have completed the requirements for the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 badge.
