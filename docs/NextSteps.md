This {{learningplan.name}} demonstrated several of the {{offering.name}} offerings available. Users learned the basics for provisioning and managing both VMware as a Service, VMware vCenter Server, VMware Cloud Foundation, and optionally VMware Shared resources. However, there is still more to learn about {{offering.name}}. Be sure to check out this <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vmware/compare_offerings" target="_blank">offering comparison page</a> as well.

Finally, remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan.

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical Sales** must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the learning plan for the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz from learn.ibm.com. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-thru demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offerings.
