IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS) provides **command line interfaces (CLI)** as a plugin to the IBM Cloud CLI. The PowerVS CLIs provide system administrators the ability to manage their PowerVS environment through command line and scripting. In most cases a seller would not demonstrate this capability unless they were doing so to a very technical audience, like system administrators that will be responsible for provisioning PowerVS resources.

PowerVS provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform these actions within an application. The PowerVS APIs are not covered in this demonstration guide. Learn more about the PowerVS APIs <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud" target="_blank">here</a>.

PowerVS also has a published a Terraform provider to allow administrators to use infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate the provisioning of PowerVS resources. The Terraform provider is outside of the scope of this demonstration guide.

In this chapter, explore a variety of CLI instructions that can be issued via the IBM Cloud Shell portal for administration of a PowerVS instance. Topics include:

- Inspection of all PowerVS services provisioned
- Setting the service target of the IBM Cloud Shell to the instance ID of the PowerVS environment
- Setting the target of future PowerVS plugin commands to an environment variable
- Inspection of the four virtual machines (VMs) provisioned as part of the PowerVS environment, including AIX and RHEL
- Restarting a virtual machine programmatically
- Generating an SSH private key for managing the PowerVS environment

There are hundreds of potential CLI instructions which can be issued â€” our goal is not to be exhaustive and not go into every command in detail, but rather provide a representative sampling of jobs that can be performed programmatically via the CLI. Using this foundational knowledge, more tailored demonstrations can be crafted for specific client needs.
