In this Part of the demonstration script, you learned how to

   - provision an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS
   - use the IBM Cloud Satellite command line interfaces (CLIs)

As a next step, think about how you would demonstrate this capability to your client. Remember, several options were suggested in [Demonstrate: How to provision a Location](02.03 Demonstrate: How to provision a Location.md). Keep in mind, demonstrating this capability does not necessarily illustrate the value proposition of IBM Cloud Satellite as you learned in your Level 2 training; however, it may appeal to more technical audiences. Make sure you consider your audience when you plan your demonstration.

In Part 2, learn how to deploy an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled service to an IBM Cloud Satellite Location.
