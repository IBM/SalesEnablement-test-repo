Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are available for IBM Cloud Satellite. In this section, explore the CLI capabilities related to IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. You can learn more about all the IBM Cloud Satellite CLIs <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-satellite-cli-reference" target="_blank">here</a>. When doing client demonstrations, it is important to understand who is in your audience. Performing demonstrations of CLIs to a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO) may not be well received; however, this type of demonstration may resonate well with other audiences like members of the IT staff, line-of-business developers, and others. These audiences will want to know that CLIs exist to perform the IBM Cloud Satellite tasks as they will probably want to further automate them in their deployments.

In this part of the demonstration, you will use the IBM Cloud Shell. If you are not familiar with IBM Cloud Shell, you can learn about it <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-shell?topic=cloud-shell-getting-started" target="_blank">here</a>.

!!! tip
    Use the **copy** capability of the demonstration guide to copy and paste commands to the IBM Cloud Command Shell to avoid typing errors.

1. In the IBM Cloud Portal, with the demonstration account selected (**{{ account }}**), click the IBM Cloud Shell icon.

The IBM Cloud Shell will open in a new browser tab or window. It may take a few seconds for the shell to initialize.

2. Synchronize the Role-based access controls (RBAC) for the IBM Cloud Satellite Location's OpenShift cluster.

```
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster {{ aws.cluster_id }}
```

??? example "Example output"
    OK

    The configuration for {{ aws.cluster_id }} was downloaded successfully.

    Added context for {{ aws.cluster_id }} to the current kubeconfig file.
    You can now execute 'kubectl' commands against your cluster. For example, run 'kubectl get nodes'.
    If you are accessing the cluster for the first time, 'kubectl' commands might fail for a few seconds while RBAC synchronizes.

!!! info "Important"
    The above command forces the RBAC to be synchronized between IBM Cloud and the Red Hat OpenShift cluster running in the IBM Cloud Satellite Location. If this command is not run, issues may be encountered later in this demonstration.


3. List the IBM Cloud Satellite Locations.

```
ibmcloud sat locations
```

??? example "Example output"

    OK

??? failure "If this fails"
    Occasionally, the above command may time out with a "FAILED: Could not complete request" message.  Try running the command again.

6. Get the details for a specific host.

!!! tip
    You may need to replace the string **{{ aws.host_ip }}** with the name of one of the hosts from the previous command.

```copycommand
ibmcloud sat host get --location {{ aws.location }} --host {{ aws.host_ip }}
```

All the commands executed above are commands that list or view the details of an IBM Cloud Satellite object. There are also commands to create, remove, and modify these objects. You will perform these types of actions in a later demonstration. In this demonstration environment, you do **not** have permissions to add, remove or change Locations or Hosts.

!!! info inline end "AWS CLI install steps"

!!! note "Extra Credit"
    Did you know you can install the AWS command line utilities in your IBM Cloud Shell instance? It doesn't stay persistent, but it only takes a few seconds to install and configure. IBM Cloud Satellite clients may find this useful in managing their hybrid cloud environment.

    For this demonstration, we do not provide the credentials to complete the configuration.
