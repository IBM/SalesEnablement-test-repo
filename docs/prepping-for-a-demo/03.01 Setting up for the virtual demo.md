    Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.

    - Alexander Graham Bell

Don't wait to the last minute. Make sure the IBM TechZone environment you need is up and running the day before the event and will be available for at least one additional day in case someone wants a follow-up. Setup all the tools you will need before hand.  Given this event will be virtual, make sure everything works with the e-meeting technology you will be using (i.e. WebEx, Zoom, etc).

    Practice makes perfect.

    - Benjamin Franklin

Make sure you practice the demonstration flow. There is nothing more embarrassing than a demonstration that fails. Know the steps you are going to take. Know what you will say. Plan on handling errors that may occur. If you are using the "baking show" approach, make sure you practice what you will say in the transition from canceling out of doing an actual creation of a resource to moving to a fully provisioned instance of the resource. And most importantly, **practice, practice, practice**.

Before completing this activity and watching the final video of the IBM Cloud Satellite L3 Seller learning plan, watch this informal, unscripted video on how the presenter set up for the client event.
