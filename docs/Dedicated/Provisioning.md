Now it is time to provision a VMware vCenter Server (VCS) instance. Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice provisioning a VCS instance.

Note, fields that require a text entry (e.g. service name) are pre-populated in the click-thru demonstration.

!!! tip
    Not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen and the spot to click next will be highlighted.

1. Open the link below and then click the play button ![](_attachments/ClickThruPlayButton.png) to begin the demonstration.

**Click-thru demo:** <a href="https://ibm.github.io/SalesEnablement-VMware-L3/includes/VMware-Dedicated-Provisioning/index.html" target ="_blank">Provision an instance of IBM Cloud VMware Solutions **Dedicated**</a>

2. Click the **VMware** ![](_attachments/VMicon.png) icon in the left hand menu bar.
3. Click the **VMware vCenter Server** tile.

??? question "BP quiz question"
    Take note of the VMware vSphere version.

4. Click in the **Instance name** text entry field.

The Instance name field will automatically change to {{itz.dedicated.instanceName}}. The IBM Cloud portal provides the ability to provision a new instance based on a previously saved template.

5. Click the **Resource Group** pull-down menu.
6. Select the **{{itz.resourceGroup}}** option.

VCS supports multisite vCenter Server instances. In this demonstration, only a primary instance is provisioned. Learn more about multisite vCenter instances <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_multisite" target="_blank">here</a>.

7. Click **Licensing** in the left hand menu.

Learn more about the licensing options <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_orderinginstance-licensing-settings" target="_blank">here</a>.

??? question "BP quiz question"
    Take note of the 4 NSX license options.

8. Under the **NSX** section, click the pull-down menu that currently shows **Data Center SP Professional**.
9. Select the **Data Center SP Advanced** option.

In this deployment, a single **Consolidated** cluster will be used. **Consolidated** clusters are used for both the management components of the VCS deployment as well as client workloads. This is typically fine for small deployments, and will potentially save the client some money. However, for larger deployments with varying performance requirements for workloads, separating the management cluster from other workload clusters is the preferred architecture. Refer to the documentation for more details on management and workload clusters <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-scb-orderinginstance-consoli" target="_blank">here</a>.

Later the other options for to provision dedicated **Workload** and **Edge services** clusters will be explored, but for this environment a single **Consolidated** cluster is used.

10. Under **Data center location**, click the **Geography** pull-down menu that currently shows **NA South**.

Notice, VCS instances can be deployed in many of the IBM Cloud data centers located around the world. Typically, data centers are selected based upon geographic location either for data sovereignty and/or proximity reasons. However, it is also important to note that not all the IBM Cloud data centers have the same capabilities. Consult the **IBM Cloud data center availability** section of the documentation <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_planning" target="_blank">here</a>.

11. Select the **NA West** option.
12. Select the **SJC04** data center option.

Next, a hardware configuration for the bare-metal servers needs to be specified. VCS can be provisioned on many different hardware configurations, including SAP certified hardware.

13. Click the **Dual Intel Xeon Silver 4210** radio button in the **CPU model** table.
14. Click the **RAM** pull-down menu that currently shows **768 GB**.
15. Select the **128 GB** option.
16. Click the **Include a separate, additional workload cluster** checkbox.

Notice the form expands to allow a new hardware configuration to be specified for a separate **Workload** cluster just like for the **Consolidated** cluster. If a client desires to separate their workload cluster from the management cluster, this option should be selected. Often clients will opt for multiple workload cluster based upon the CPU, memory, and storage requirements of the workloads.

17. Click the **Include a separate, additional workload cluster.** checkbox again to **disable** the separate **Workload cluster**.
18. Click the **Edge services cluster** checkbox.

A dedicated **Edge services** cluster is often desirable for large deployments that require additional separation of the edge services and custom firewall components. Notice the hardware options for the **Edge services** cluster are fewer than for the **Consolidate** and **Workload** clusters.

19. Click the **Edge services cluster** checkbox again to **disable** the separate **Edge services cluster**.
20. Click the **Domain name** text entry field under the **Network interface** section.

Network planning for any VCS deployment is critical. Clients are expected to make informed decisions when provisioning their VCS environment and when specifying network configuration options. More planning information is available in the VCS documentation starting <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_networkingonvcenterserver" target="_blank">here</a>.

A valid **Domain name** needs to be specified for the VCS deployment. The Domain name field will automatically change to **myroot.mydomain.com** for this environment. Notice how both the **Hostname prefix** and **Domain name** fields are used to specify the complete hostnames for the bare-metal servers. The **Configure host names individually** checkbox can be used for clients that desire to specify hostnames individually.

21. Click the **Add-on services** option in left hand menu.

When ordering a VCS instances, clients can also include add-on services.

22. Click the **Edit** link in the **Veeam 11** tile under **Recommended services**.

Veeam on IBM Cloud is a non-IBM product that is offered under terms and conditions from Veeam, not IBM

23. Click the **Name** text entry field in the **Configure Veeam** dialog.

The **Name** field will automatically change to **veeam-l3**.

In the next steps, specify the size and performance of the storage to be used by Veeam. More information on Veeam capacity planning can be found <a href="https://helpcenter.veeam.com/archive/one/100/reporter/capacity_planning_for_repositories.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

25. Select the **2000 GB** option.
26. Click the **Storage performance** pull-down menu that currently shows **0.25 IOPS/GB**.
27. Select the **0.25 IOPS/GB** option.
