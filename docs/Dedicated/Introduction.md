**IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Dedicated** provides a single-tenant, client-managed VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) solution that is designed to deliver extreme flexibility for customers with root access down to the hypervisor level. There are two solution types: VMware vCenter Server and VMware vSphere. vCenter Server is a fully automated, standardized VMware softwareâ€“defined data center while VMware vSphere offers more customization of VMware components and licensing. Both solutions provide the option to purchase IBM-provided licenses or to bring your own license (BYOL). Note, this demonstration script is only focused on the VMware vCenter Server (VCS) offering.

VCS is a hosted private cloud that delivers the VMware vSphere stack as a service. The VMware environment is built on top of a minimum of three IBM Cloud bare metal servers, shared file-level storage or dedicated VMware vSAN storage, and it includes the automatic deployment and configuration of an easy to manage logical edge firewall that is powered by VMware NSX.

The entire environment can be provisioned in a matter of hours, and the elastic bare metal infrastructure can scale out the compute capacity rapidly when needed. IBM Cloud provides clients with full, native root access to the VMware ESXi hosts, NSX Manager, and the centralized platform for management, vCenter Server.
Workloads can be moved to and from the cloud without changing the applications, tools, scripts, or investing in new skills. Platform instances and expansion nodes are priced per month and they include access to IBM Support and all VMware components that comprise the service.

In the following modules, you will:

- Explore the process of provisioning a **VCS** instance via the IBM Cloud portal.

- Explore using the IBM Cloud portal to manage a **VCS** instance.
