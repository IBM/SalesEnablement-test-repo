Now it is time to provision a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) instance. Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice provisioning a VCF instance.

The VCF instance in this click-thru demonstration was created using the **consolidated** architecture and not the **standard** architecture with separate management and workload clusters.

!!! tip
    
    Due to the number of inputs required for provisioning a VCF cluster, a few additional features have been added to this click thru-demonstration. In the IBM Cloud portal, notice there are quite a few information icons ![](_attachments/infoIcon.png) for various fields. If they appear above the next click position ![](_attachments/greenBox.png), they can be clicked to learn more about that particular field. 
    
    Scrolling in the user interface (UI) is required. A **Click to Scroll** icon will appear when the UI needs to scroll. This was added so ample time is available to read all the various fields in the UI. 
    
    If you are ever not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen and the spot to click next will be highlighted.
