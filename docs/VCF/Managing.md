Now it is time to provision a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) instance. Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice provisioning a VCF instance.

The VCF instance in this click-thru demonstration was created using the **consolidated** architecture and not the **standard** architecture with separate management and workload clusters.

!!! tip
    
    In this click-thru demonstration, several different user interfaces are used: the IBM Cloud Portal for VCF, IBM Cloud Portal for VPC, and Microsoft Remote Desktop. When switching between these interfaces a **Click to Continue** button will appear. Simply click it and the context will switch to the next interface.
    
    If you are ever not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen and the spot to click next will be highlighted.
