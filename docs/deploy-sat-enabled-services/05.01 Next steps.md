In this part of the demonstration script, you learned how to provision an IBM Cloud Satellite enabled service to a Satellite Location in AWS.

As a next step, think about how you would demonstrate this capability to your client. Remember, several options were suggested. Keep in mind, demonstrating this capability does not necessarily illustrate the value proposition of IBM Cloud Satellite as you learned in your Level 2 training; however, it may appeal to more technical audiences. Make sure you consider your audience when you plan your demonstration.

In Part 3, learn how to deploy and manage a cloud native application using **IBM Cloud Satellite config**.
