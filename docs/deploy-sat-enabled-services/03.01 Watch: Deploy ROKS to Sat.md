This video shows the provisioning of a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS. The video has been edited to minimize the viewing time and does not reflect the actual provisioning time of an OpenShift cluster. The actual provisioning time (from clicking "Create" to the clusters being ready) will vary. When this video was created, it took approximately 50 minutes for the cluster to be provisioned in the Satellite location in AWS.

Use this video to understand the talking points you can use with a client when describing the provisioning process.
