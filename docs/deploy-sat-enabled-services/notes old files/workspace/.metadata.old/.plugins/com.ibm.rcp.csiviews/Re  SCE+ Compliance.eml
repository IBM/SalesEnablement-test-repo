<font size=3D"2" face=3D"sans-serif">Comment</font><br>
<font size=3D"3" face=3D"serif">In reviewing the knowledge base article=
 above, I am curious as to what the process would be to accomplish what=
 is stated in the last sentence: &quot;IBM will work with individual cu=
stomers to assess their regulatory requirements and obtain the required=
 compliance certifications for the end-to-end offering.&quot; In order =
to proceed with a deal I am working to host the United States Golf Asso=
ciation's website, I need to have a PCI compliant environment. This inc=
ludes 2-factor authentication. I am going about the engagement using a =
custom/ wrapper approach, but don't think it will be successful. I will=
 engage a TSM who will bring in the security folks to add in logging, a=
uditing, FIM, etc., but I still keep hearing we can't do 2-factor authe=
ntication. Assuming we can pull together the whole solution, I am not c=
lear on who to get the compliance certifications for the end to end off=
ering. I could use the ITS ISS group, but it would be expensive to do j=
ust one deal with them. I did speak with a rep. in their group last wee=
k who stated it is better to do the entire SCE+ farm at once since it w=
ould be the same effort as doing just one customer. They would start wi=
th a gap analysis, and then after we fill the gaps, come back and certi=
fy the farm. Bottom line is I have a deal that works great with SCE+ if=
 we can make it PCI compliant. I would like to modify the knowledge art=
icle above to either 1) specifically outline the process to obtain a PC=
I compliant SCE+ environment, or 2) specifically state we can not do PC=
I environments. It is important we find a way to stop dancing around th=
is topic. That knowledge base article is confusing as I am not clear if=
 it is saying we can or if we can't do it. I plan to propose a DPS solu=
tion to USGA if I can't work this out with SCE+. I will be pushing over=
 the next few weeks to develop a PCI compliant solution for USGA. Pleas=
e share any advice or process that may exist to facilitate this effort.=
 I would like this deal to clear the way for others. Thanks!</font><fon=
