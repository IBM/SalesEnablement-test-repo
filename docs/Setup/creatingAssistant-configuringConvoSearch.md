# Creating an assistant and configuring conversational search
[Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?p1=Search&p4=43700077722754881&p5=e&p9=58700008198244496&gad_source=1&gclsrc=ds) allows you to create and configure an assistant with conversational search capabilities. Configure your assistant to use conversational search by using a hosted [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) instance. The pre-configured instance of watsonx Orchestrate in IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) boasts over 220 knowledge sources and supports Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The large language model (LLM) providing conversational AI augments this knowledge based on IBM Z documentation, generating IBM Z context-aware responses to queries with content-grounded knowledge.

A high-level, logical architecture of the environment is illustrated in the following diagram.

6.  Enable **conversational search** and then click **Save**.

    ![](_attachments/genAISetupCS3.png)
       
7.  Update the conversational search **custom service** settings based on your requirements.

    **Note**: The **Settings** page is divided into two sections in the following images to enhance the visibility of the screen captures. 
    
    Learn more about these **custom service** settings <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-conversational-search#tuning-the-generated-response-length-in-conversational-search" target="_blank">here</a>.

    The following settings are proven to work well. You can experiment with these settings to see how they affect queries for your client's pilot.

    **a**. Enable **Conversational search**.

    **b**. Select **Single turn**. **Multi-turn conversation** (by selecting Entire conversation) is supported by the offering, but has not been fully included in the lab guide. See the callout in the [Testing conversational search](creatingAssistant-configuringConvoSearch.md#testing-conversational-search) section below.
    
    **c**. Specify the text that appears to instruct the user to expand the list of citations in the assistant (except web chat client).

    **d**. Select **Lowest** for the **retrieval confidence threshold** setting. This setting checks the confidence of the retrieved citations before a response is generated.

    **e**. Select **Verbose** for the **generated response length**. This setting affects the average response length. Depending on user input, variations from the selected length can occur.

    **f**. Select **Lowest** for the **response confidence threshold**. This setting checks the confidence of the generated citations after the response is generated.

    ![](_attachments/genAISettings1.png)

    **g**. Keep the default setting of **All** for the listing of citations.

    **h**. Keep the **Default filter** field empty.

    **i**. The **Metadata** field provides a way to adjust your assistantâ€™s behavior during conversational search for your OpenSearch instance. This option is explored in detail in the [Installing and using zassist to ingest client documents](../byosd/zassist.md). Leave the field empty for now.

    **j**. The **Search display text** options specify the default text displayed when no results are found or when connectivity issues to the backend search service occur. You can keep the defaults or customize the service.

## Configure the base large language model
There are enhancements that you can make to configure how the large language model (LLM) responds to your queries, including adding prompt instructions and configuring the LLMâ€™s answer behavior.
The options are summarized <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.x?topic=assistant-configuring-base-llm" target="_blank">here</a>.

1.  Hover over the **Home** (![](_attachments/homeIcon.png)) and click **Generative AI**.
    
    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI1.png)

2.  Click **Add instructions**.

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI2.png)

3.  Enter a **prompt instruction**.

    Your assistant's LLM gives refined responses by following the prompt's instructions, which clarify how to achieve the end-goal of an action.

    Enter prompt instructions in the field. The maximum number of characters you can enter in the prompt instruction field is 1,000. 
        
    The following is an example prompt instruction that works well. Experiment with different prompt instructions.

    ```
    You are a subject matter expert on mainframe systems. Please respond to all prompts with truth and accuracy. Keep all answers short and concise, unless requested to provide details.
    ```

    **Note**: When the instructions are typed in, they are automatically saved and the LLM is immediately trained on them.

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI3.png)

4.  Toggle **General-purpose answering** to **Off** and then click **Save** (![](_attachments/diskIcon.png)).

    The ability exists to configure the answering behavior of your assistant to provide responses that are based on the preinstalled content or general content.

    On the **Generative AI** page (under **Prompt Instructions**), you see the **Answer behavior** section. After you configure **Conversational search**, you see that it is enabled (toggled on) with the search integration added.

    If you enable both general-purpose answering and conversational search, conversational search answering takes precedence over General-purpose answering. 
    
    **Recommendation**: For purposes of retrieving Z-specific answers and responses, it is recommended that you turn off general-purpose answering and leave only conversational search turned on.

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI4.png)

## Testing conversational search
Now, you can begin issuing queries to test the assistant's responses. For more detailed responses, try appending "Please provide a detailed response." to the end of your question.

**Important**: Modify settings iteratively based on your assessment of response quality. Review and change them at any time. For example, add extra prompt instructions, change response verbosity, and modify OpenSearch indexes.

1. Hover over the **Home** (![](_attachments/homeIcon.png)) and click **Preview**.

    ![](_attachments/preview0.png)

2.  Experiment with different prompts and validate that the answers are reasonable and related to IBM Z.

    Other prompts and responses follow. 
    
    **Note**: The responses that you receive can vary from the ones shown.

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    What is z/OS continuous delivery?
    ```

    Example output:

    ![](_attachments/preview0a.png)

    **Prompt**: 

    ```
    What is the APF list in z/OS? Provide a detailed explanation?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview1.png)

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    Why is Db2 different than other database systems?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview2.png)

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    What happens during an IPL on IBM Z?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview3.png)

    !!! info "Experiment with multi-turn (entire conversation) contextual awareness."

        In the December 2024 release of {{offering.name}} support for multi-turn contextual awareness was added. This capability enables the assistant to use an entire session history for retrieving search results and generating answers. This handles context-dependent questions well but may over-rely on past topics, even if the user has moved on.

        Experiment with this setting by changing your custom service contextual awareness setting from **Single turn** to **Entire conversation**.

        ![](_attachments/multiturn-0.png)

        Once enabled, try sequential prompts like:

        ```
        What are some features of z/OS?
        ```

        ```
        Give me an itemized list?
        ```

        ```
        Tell me more about item 3.
        ```
