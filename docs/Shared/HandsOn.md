Thus far, the experience provided in this learning plan with IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared has been through videos and click-thru demonstrations. As an optional exercise, a hands-on environment of the **VMware Shared** instance built during the earlier modules is available through an IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment that you can reserve. IBMers are strongly encouraged to utilize this environment as part of their Stand and Deliver required for the {{learningplan.name}} completion.

!!! warning "LIMITED ACCESS"
    The user access provided to the instance in ITZ is restricted utilizing IBM Cloud's Identity and Access Management controls. Users will have the ability to view the VMware Shared instances already provisioned in the account via the IBM Cloud Portal and the ability to deploy a VM and/or vApp using VMware vCloud Directory. Users will NOT have the ability to provision new VMware Shared instances or modify the existing instances. However, even with these restrictions, the environment can be used in performing demonstrations using a "baking-show" demonstration approach as an alternative to using the click-thru demos. To learn more about the "baking-show" method, check out this <a href="https://cruxcollaborative.com/insights/your-software-demo-should-be-more-like-a-cooking-show" target="_blank">article</a>.

    Note: other ITZ environments are available for IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions that may provide additional access.  Use "VMware on IBM Cloud" in the ITZ search tool.

In the video below, learn how to make a reservation in ITZ, how to access the existing VMware Shared instance, and what all can be done in the provided environment. Note, many of the steps illustrated in the video have been sped up to reduce the length of video. Use the steps from the **Managing** click-thru demo from the previous module once your ITZ environment is ready.
