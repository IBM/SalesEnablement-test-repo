**IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared** provides customizable deployment choices of VMware Virtual Data Center environments, all provisioned through automation in IBM Cloud for standardized, reliable, enterprise-ready deployments. VMware Shared virtual data center instances can quickly and seamlessly migrate or deploy VMware workloads to the cloud on IBM hosted and VMware certified infrastructure. The service provides Identity Access Management (IAM) out of the box and is validated for financial services use cases.

#
#IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared is built around three key pillars:

1. **Cost-effective scalability**: Customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow if they require more resources over time. As a result, customers can minimize their unused capacity and save money. Instead of buying fixed-size virtual machines, clients can instead purchase compute capacity (as needed) and provision any number of virtual machines (of different sizes) within the capacity limit they set.

2. **Temporary migration, colocation, and burst**: Multi-site data centers are consolidated within a single location by migrating workloads from different sources.

3. **Disaster recovery**: A suite of preinstalled services provide options for disaster recovery of critical workloads, achieving recovery point objectives (RPOs) within seconds, and maintaining application consistency. These services include Veeam Availability Suite, Veeam Cloud Connect, and Zerto.

The offering is ideal for enterprise clients that currently operate VMware workloads on-premises, but need to adopt cloud as part of their digital transformation and modernization strategy. The automation and added support speeds the time to delivery and reduces the risks that might otherwise be present if a client attempted to "roll their own" cloud deployment.

Furthermore, the IBM Cloud infrastructure is competitively priced and managed by IBM keeping capital expenditures stay low. The scalability of cloud supports a pathway to further growth and investment.
