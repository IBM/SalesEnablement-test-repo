IBM Cloud for VMware as a Service (VMwaaS) provides the VMware Cloud Director platform as a managed service. IBM does the configuration, hosting, operations, and lifecycle management of the VMware software so clients can quickly deploy their VMware-based cloud computing environments with simplified management and reduced costs.

IBM Cloud for VMware as a Service provides the VMware Cloud Director platform as either a dedicated or shared managed service. Compute resources are available as either dedicated or multitenant hosts that use IBM Cloud bare metal servers. Dedicated single-tenant VMware sites provide extra isolation and support multiple host configuration options to support flexible workload requirements.

    All sellers, especially technical sellers, should read the VMwaaS overview documentation found <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmware-aas-overview" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally, while most of the underlying VMware products that are utilized in the offering are hidden from the end client, some clients may ask about the versions utilized. This information is available in the VMware as a Service release notes found <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmware-service-relnotes" target="_blank">here</a>.

As mentioned earlier, VMwaaS utilizes a shared responsibility model that includes IBM-managed infrastructure and IBM managed VMware components and services up to the hypervisor. For details on the client responsibilities when using VMWaaS go <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmaas-understand-responsib" target="_blank">here</a>. The division of responsibility should be explained to clients.
