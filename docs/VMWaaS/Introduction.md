IBM Cloud for VMware as a Service (VMaaS) provides the VMware Cloud Director platform as a managed service. IBM does the configuration, hosting, operations, and lifecycle management of the VMware software so clients can quickly deploy their VMware-based cloud computing environments, simplify management, and reduce costs.

Today, compute resources are available as single-tenant, dedicated hosts, on IBM Cloud bare metal servers, with multiple host configurations available to address various workload requirements. Both Network File Storage (NFS) and VMware vSAN storage options are available, along with a broad ecosystem of enterprise-grade add-on services for backup, migration, and disaster recovery.

The high-level architecture diagram illustrates the management responsibilities of VMWaaS versus a client-managed VMware infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering.
