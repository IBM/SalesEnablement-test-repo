When preparing for a client demonstration, or for IBMers doing their stand and deliver recording, don't wait to the last minute. Make sure the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment that you need is up and running and the reservation is not about to expire. If the demonstration is to be given virtually, make sure everything works with the e-meeting technology you are using (i.e. Webex, Zoom, and so on).

Make sure you practice the demonstration flow. There is nothing more embarrassing than a demonstration that fails. Know the steps that you are going to take. Know what you will say. Plan on handling errors that might occur. If you are using the "baking show" approach, practice what you will say in the transition from canceling the creation of a resource to moving to a fully provisioned instance. And most importantly, practice, practice, practice.

In the demonstration video that follows, only VMware as a Service Single-tenant is featured.
