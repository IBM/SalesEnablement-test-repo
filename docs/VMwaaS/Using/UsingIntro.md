In previous chapters, the IBM Cloud Portal was used to provision a VMware as a Service instance or site, a provider virtual data center (PVDC), infrastructure clusters, and virtual data centers (VDCs). Now it is time to switch gears and use the VMware Cloud Director (vCloud Director or vCD) to provision virtual machines (VMs) to run the client's workloads. 

However, since most workloads consist of more than single machines that run isolated from other resources, some network configuration needs to be done first.

In the next chapter, learn how the VMwaaS network in the ITZ demonstration environment was setup by stepping through one last click-thru demonstration.
