The video below walks through the demonstration scenarios outlined in the previous two chapters and highlights the features and values of IBM Cloud Satellite covered in this activity. This example does not follow the first scenario step-by-step, rather the presenter choose to utilize the videos from the chapter on provisioning a location. Both methods can be affective.

In this mock client presentation, the presenter utilizes several assets available in this demonstration guide including:

- the high level architecture diagrams shown in "The environment" and "Deploy a web app using Sat Config" chapters
- the two (2) video demonstrating provisioning a Satellite location in AWS and a location using the manual process

These assets were downloaded locally via the web browser by right clicking on the asset and selecting the download option. Both were pre-loaded in an appropriate viewer.

Additionally the presenter preloaded most of the web pages that are accessed as part of the demonstration including:

- IBM Cloud Portal
- Red Hat OpenShift web console for both the {{ sat.cluster_name }} (production) and the {{ ibm.cluster }} (development) clusters.
- GitHub repository

Preloading these pages saves time and allows the presentation to flow smoother by prearranging the browser windows and tabs. When preparing this way, make sure all authentication tokens are valid just before starting the demonstration!
