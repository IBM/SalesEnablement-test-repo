The video below walks through the demonstration steps outlined in the previous two chapters and highlights the features and values of IBM Cloud Satellite covered in this activity.

In this video, the presenter utilizes several assets available in this demonstration guide including:

- the high level architectural diagram shown in "The environment" chapter
- the video demonstrating provisioning a Satellite location in AWS

These assets were downloaded locally using via the web browser by right clicking on the asset and selecting the download option. Both were pre-loaded in an appropriate viewer.

Additionally the presenter preloaded most of the web pages that are access as part of the demonstration including:

- IBM Cloud Portal
- Red Hat OpenShift web console for both the {{ sat.cluster_name }} (production) and the {{ ibm.cluster }} (development) clusters.
- GitHub repository

Preloading these pages saves time and allows the presentation to flow smoother. When preparing this way, make sure all authentication tokens are valid just before starting the demonstration!
