!!! Note Update

    This Level 3 was originally written in late 2022. Since, the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions portfolio has added several new offerings including **VMware as a Service (VMwaaS)** and **Cyber Recovery**. In the near future **VMwaaS** will support both single-tenant (available today) and multi-tenant capabilities. When the multi-tenant capability is available, the plan is to phase out the **VMware Shared** offering. Given that direction, this Level 3 has been updated to include a **VMwaaS** module and the **VMware Shared** module is now optional. The Stand and Deliver requirements for IBM employees and the business partner quiz have been updated to reflect these changes. 
    
    Note, images and videos in this demonstration guide may not reflect the latest changes in the portal.

Welcome to the **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions - Level 3** course and demonstration guide! The goal is to provide Sellers and Technical Sellers, including both IBMers and Business Partners, with the knowledge and tools to perform click-thru demonstrations of the **VMware as a Service**, **VMware Dedicated**, and optionally, **VMware Shared** offerings.

 This course is not intended to serve as a deep dive into VMware-specific topics; rather the focus is on the ```IBM Cloud``` aspects of the offerings. Numerous links and pointers to additional content around VMware-specific features are included in each of the modules of this course.

Most modules are accompanied by recordings and narrated instructions, delivered by your team of authors. Be sure to watch these for a visual demonstration of how to perform the hands-on lab components. In particular, it is strongly recommended that IBM Sellers and Technical Sellers watch these recordings — they will be useful for you as you go about creating and recording your own Stand & Deliver presentations for Level 3 accreditation.

!!! tip "ACCREDITATION"
    To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements— and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation —differs depending on job role.

**Business Partners** must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. **Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz. Watch for the "BP quiz question" ![](_attachments/questionICON.png) icon in the demonstration guide.**

**IBM Sales and Tech Sales** must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab.

Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course. Before jumping into the next module, please read the guidance below. Your comprehension of the information outlined below will save you time while completing the lab work.

!!! tip "FIND HELP"

# Navigating the Lab Guide
-----------------------------

The Level 3 demonstration guide is organized into three chapters, covering the ```VMware as a Service```, ```VMware Dedicated```, and ```VMware Shared``` offerings of the **IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions** portfolio. These chapters contain modules that provide an *Introduction* to offering, steps to *Provision* a deployment, and explore how clients *Manage* their instance through the IBM Cloud portal and the respective VMware tools.

!!! warning "WARNING"
    The agile nature of cloud means that the interface and layout of the IBM Cloud Portal, as well as the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions offering, will change on a regular basis. Screenshots and videos captured within this documentation may not always reflect the latest versions available from IBM Cloud — although the IBM Technology Sales Enablement team strives to update these assets on a regular basis.
