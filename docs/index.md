??? tip "Printing the demonstration guide"

    !!! Warning "Printed or saved copies can be out of date"

        The {{guide.name}} changes regularly to match the {{offering.name}} offering and associated ITZ environment. Printed or saved copies of the demonstration guide can become out-of-date quickly and result in failed steps. 

    A ready-to-print PDF version of the {{guide.name}} is <a href="{{guide.pdf}}" target="_blank">here</a>. 

<a id="cheatsheet"></a>
??? tip "Create a reference card for storing user IDs, passwords, and links for your ITZ environments."

    You will be creating and using multiple user IDs, passwords, links, and other content throughout the lab. To save time, it is strongly suggested you create a simple text file to store this data so it is readily available and you can easily cut and paste the data when needed.  Here is a template to get you started.

??? tip "Acronyms and terminology"

    IBM employees and the tech industry in general, tend to use acronyms. In the demonstration guide, most acronyms will appear with a dashed underline. Hover over the acronym to learn its meaning. A question mark (![](_attachments/questionIcon.png)) icon will first appear and after a second the tool tip with the acronym's meaning is displayed. Try it here: LPAR.

??? tip "The **Lab Guide** table of contents"

    This **Demonstration Guide** uses a responsive browser-based interface to ensure pages are usable on various devices with different screen sizes. The Demonstration Guide table of contents may be displayed as highlighted in the green dashed box in this image:

    ![](_attachments/demoGuide1a.png)

    However, if the browser window is sized smaller, the table of contents can be accessed by clicking the main menu icon (![](_attachments/MainMenuIcon.png)):
