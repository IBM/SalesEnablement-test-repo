# Importing pre-packaged z/OS skills
Provided with Version 2 of watsonx Assistant for Z is a set of pre-packaged skills. These skills are used to automate various tasks on z/OS, such as running different console commands and retrieving logs from batch jobs.

- Display zOS parmlib datasets

- UNIX System Services options
