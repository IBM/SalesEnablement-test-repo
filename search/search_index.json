Now that you have your own docs that are ingested for conversational search, you can set the metadata field for your assistant to use those documents in its content-grounded search. If you leave the metadata field empty, then it defaults to settings found to perform well but may not use the ingested documents as part of the search results.</p> <p>If you leave the Metadata field empty, OpenSearch relies on the default settings, which means OpenSearch searches all the default IBM-provided documentation and all of the ingested customer documentation using the following value:</p> <pre><code>{\"ibm_indices\":\"*_ibm_docs_slate,*_ibm_redbooks_slate\",\n\u201ccustomer_indices\u201d:\u201ccustomer_*\u201d}\n</code></pre> <p>Replacing the wildcard string with an explicit list of indices allows for personalization. The metadata setting is where you can input specific indices (pointing to the underlying documentation) that you want your assistant to use for the content-grounded search. There are over 220 products and topics that the OpenSearch instance has IBM Documentation for. You can find those indices and products here.</p> <p>You can input a subset of indices into the \u201cMetadata\u201d field in cases where you want your assistant to only gather context for specific IBM products or topics. The specific indices can be listed out in this format:</p> <pre><code>{\u201cibm_indices\u201d:\u201c&lt;comma separated index values&gt;\u201d,\u201ccustomer_indices\u201d:\u201ccustomer_*\u201d}\n</code></pre> <p>For example, if you want your assistant to reference only documentation for \u201cDb2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS\u201d and no ingested client documentation, you can enter the following into the metadata field:</p> <pre><code>{\u201cibm_indices\u201d:\u201css4lq8_ibm_docs_slate\u201d}\n</code></pre> <p>If you have a mix of IBM Documentation and client documentation ingested, then there\u2019s an optional search string that you can use to set the \u201cweights\u201d used for each. </p> <p>For example:</p> <p></p><pre><code>{\"doc_weight\":\n{\"product_docs\":0.5,\n\"customer_docs\":0.5},\n\"ibm_indices\":\"*_ibm_docs_slate,*_ibm_redbooks_slate\",\n\"standardize\":true,\n\"customer_indices\":\"customer_*\"\n}\n</code></pre> In this case, \u201cproduct_docs\u201d is the weight that is assigned to \u201cibm_indices\u201d and \u201ccustomer_docs\u201d is the weight that is assigned to \u201ccustomer_indices\u201d. For more information on customizing the metadata field for conversational search, refer to this supplemental video found here. <ol> <li> <p>Set the (a) Metadata field for your BYOS custom search instance to the following value, click (b) Save, and then click (c) Close. Notice the weight for customer_docs is heavier than the weight for product_docs.</p> <pre><code>{\"doc_weight\":\n{\"product_docs\":0.2,\n\"customer_docs\":0.8},\n\"ibm_indices\":\"*_ibm_docs_slate,*_ibm_redbooks_slate\",\n\"standardize\":true,\n\"customer_indices\":\"customer_*\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Hover over the Home () icon and click Preview.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Restart conversation () icon.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the queries four queries run earlier and record the results and the order of the response citations.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Compare the two sets of results. Notice how the answers changed based on the weighting of the ingested documents versus the IBM product documentation. Were the ingested documents always the first document cited? If not, why do you think that is? </p> <p>Before proceeding, experiment with different metadata and other configuration settings for your custom service instance.</p> <p>For client pilots</p> <p>If you or your client have other documents to ingest, you can do so by repeating the steps using zassist.
