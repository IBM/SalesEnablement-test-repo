The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales the knowledge and tools to perform introductory demonstrations of IBM Cloud Satellite. There are 4 parts to this demonstration guide as seen in the left hand navigation: Part 1 - Setup Learn about the environment that will be utilized for this learning activity, the prerequisites required, how to create a reservation for the environment in IBM Technology Zone (ITZ), and how to setup the GitHub repository that is needed to complete the activity. Part 2 - Provisioning and configuring IBM Cloud Satellite Learn about the provisioning process for IBM Cloud Satellite Location , Satellite-enabled Services , and Link endpoints . Note, in this activity a new IBM Cloud Satellite Location will NOT be provisioned. Rather, a shared, pre-provisioned Satellite Location and cloud-enabled service (Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud) will be utilized. Videos are provided that demonstrate the provisioning processes for these resources. Part 3 - Using Satellite Config Learn about Satellite Config and how it is used to deploy Kubernetes resources to RedHat OpenShift clusters maintained in a GitHub repository. Part 4 - The demonstration In the final section, learn how to demonstrate to client's some of the value of IBM Cloud Satellite. Guidance on performing a client demonstration using the shared ITZ environment is provided that illustrates how IBM Cloud Satellite and cloud-enabled services are provisioned, and how Sat Config can be used to deploy and manage Kubernetes applications. Some content will be a labeled as Required for technical sales only . However, individuals in sales roles are highly encouraged to complete these sections and include them in their demonstrations. Step-by-steps directions are provided, but some technical knowledge and experience with source control systems like GitHub and basic Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) is assumed.

IBM Cloud Satellite is a managed, distributed cloud solution that delivers cloud services, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), access policies, security controls, and compliance. This demonstration environment has a dual purpose. First, it is meant to educate you on IBM Cloud Satellite and how to demonstrate some of the capabilities of IBM Cloud Satellite to clients. Second, the environment can be used for actual client demonstrations. After you are familiar with the content, have practice performing a demonstration, get in front of a client and show the power of IBM Cloud Satellite. Important The focus of the demonstration is on the Infrastructure as a Service capability of IBM Cloud Satellite and not on the specific services deployed to a Satellite Location (for example, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud). Provisioning a Satellite Location on a public cloud like AWS, is automated and typically takes 25-30 minutes depending on the cloud provider, configuration of the servers being used, and other factors. Deploying Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to the Satellite Location usually takes another 30-45 minutes. In addition, to easily access resources on those servers you would need to either create a Virtual Private Network or manually make network configuration changes. This can be time consuming and error prone and will typically take longer than most clients are willing to sit through for a demonstration. In this demonstration asset, an IBM Cloud Satellite environment has already been provisioned for you. In this demonstration environment, you will NOT have full access to the IBM Cloud Satellite capabilities. Your user ID will be restricted to specific capabilities. You will not have permissions to: create new Satellite Locations, Clusters, Cluster Groups, or Configurations deploy new IBM Cloud Services (for example: IBM Cloud Databases, Key Protect, etc.) Warning Attempting to perform an action that you do not have permissions for will result in an error message like the one below. This is not an issue with the IBM Cloud or IBM Cloud Satellite, rather a restriction of the demo environment and the permissions assigned to users.","title":"The environment"},{"location":"1setup/01.02%20Pre-requisites/","text":"To complete this activity you will need: - User account for IBM Cloud (IBM ID) - User account for GitHub or IBM's Enterprise GitHub ( Required for technical sales only ) - Access to IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) To create an user account in IBM's Enterprise GitHub, go here .

The full collection can be accessed here . From the collection page, click the \"Complete learning activity for...\" link in left hand menu bar to view all the resources for the collection. To make a reservation for the shared environment, click the \"Demonstration Environment: IBM Cloud Satellite - Level 3\" tile or go here . A reservation can be made for near immediate use by selecting Reserve now , or for future access using the Schedule for later option. The ITZ policy for this environment is a 2 day reservation that can be extended for a maximum of 6 days. Plan your time! While it will take approximately 4 hours to complete all sections of this activity once the reservation is ready, additional time may be needed to practice the demonstration script, complete the required Stand and Deliver (IBM employees), complete the business partner quiz (partners only), or to perform an actual client demonstration. When completing the reservation form, select Practice/Self-Education from the purpose field and specify Level 3 Training in the Purpose description field. If you are performing a client demonstration, select Customer Demo and provide a Sales Opportunity number . This environment not suitable for Proof-of-Concept (PoC) or Proof-of-Technology (PoT) activities As this is a shared environment that provides limited access, this environment should NOT be used for PopCs or PoTs. Other ITZ environments or IBM Cloud trial accounts are available for those types of activities. Before proceeding, wait until the ITZ reservation is in the Ready state. After requested, the reservation takes approximately 15 minutes to provision. Upon completion, an e-mail is sent and the reservation appears in the ready state on the ITZ My reservations page. The information contained in the email and reservation detail page is required to proceed to the next section.","title":"Create environment reservation"},{"location":"1setup/01.04%20SetupGitHub/","text":"Before proceeding, a reservation for the IBM Cloud Satellite Level 3 IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment must be available and in the Ready state. If you do not have an active reservation, return to the previous section to learn how to make the reservation. Required for technical sales only The steps below are required for technical sales only , however, all are highly encouraged to complete all sections. The steps below were carefully written to allow even the most novice GitHub users to complete the activity. Once you have a GitHub (or IBM Enterprise GitHub) user account, all should be able to follow along. No Git specific knowledge is required as the steps to be completed can all be done so using the GitHub browser interface. To learn more about GitHub check out these resources: GitHub Fundamentals For a very basic Git and GitHub tutorial, check out this Git Tutorial for Dummies . To complete the exercise, utilize either a public GitHub identification, or for IBM employees, a IBM Enterprise GitHub ID. The directions below are based on using a public GitHub identification. Log in to GitHub by opening a browser window to https://github.com/login . Note If you do not already have a GitHub user ID, you can create a free one by clicking the Create an account link on the sign in page. Open a browser window to https://github.com/IBM/satellite-config-example . Click the Fork button. Uncheck the Copy the main branch only checkbox and click Create fork . The browser should redirect to the new repository in your GitHub workspace. Select the config-sample-dev branch in the branch pull-down menu. Click the deployments folder. Next, update each of the four (4) YAML files with the namespace created specifically for you in the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment. The namespace name can be found on the ITZ reservation page (see the example below) or in the e-mail sent by ITZ for the reservation. The value will be in the format \"######ABCD-ns-se-l3\". In the images below \"2700039nft-ns-se-l3\" is used, but you must use your specific value in order to successfully complete this exercise . Why am I doing this? Because the ITZ environment is shared by all users of this demonstration guide, a common namespace cannot be used or else users would overwrite each other and cause issues when attempting to follow the instructions. Each ITZ reservation sets up a unique namespace for each user. By changing this value in the deployment YAML files for the sample application, each user is able to deploy their own copy of the application in the OpenShift clusters managed by IBM Cloud Satellite. Sample ITZ reservation page: Sample ITZ e-mail: Click the 1-helloworld-namespace.yaml file in the deployments directory. Edit the file by clicking the pencil ( ) icon. Change the value of the name field to the name of your ITZ-created namespace, remove the name: satellite-config-sample line under the labels section, and add the line deploy.razee.io/mode: \"EnsureExists\" under the labels section as shown below. Formatting in YAML is important The YAML language is very sensitive to formatting. Make sure each line aligns as illustrated in the image above. Use spaces and not tabs (2 spaces before name: and labels: and 4 spaces before deploy.razee.io/mode: ). Because the namespace is already created for you by the ITZ reservation, the deploy.razee.io/mode: \"EnsureExists\" label tells Satellite config to ignore this step if the namespace already exists. Click Commit changes... . Update the Commit message text field with an appropriate message and then click the Commit changes button. Click deployments to navigate back to the list of YAML files. Next, the other three (3) YAML files need to be updated. For each of these, only the namespace field needs to be updated. The next set of steps walk you through updating one of the files, but you must do it for all three files: 2-helloworld-deployment.yaml 3-helloworld-route.yaml 4-helloworld-svc.yaml Click the 2-helloworld-deployment.yaml file name. Edit the file by clicking the pencil ( ) icon. Change the namespace field from satellite-config-sample to your ITZ specific namespace name. Do not use 2700039nft-ns-se-l3 You must use the namespace name created specifically for you as shown in your ITZ reservation! Click the Commit changes... button. Update the Commit message text field with an appropriate message and then click the Commit changes button. Click deployments to navigate back to the list of YAML files. Repeat steps 13-18 for each of the other 2 files in the deployments directory: 3-helloworld-route.yaml 4-helloworld-svc.yaml For this demonstration, 2 branches in GitHub are used: development (dev) and production (prod). The changes just made in the dev branch need to be made in the prod branch as well. This can be done manually using the steps above, or a pull request can be completed to copy all changes from the dev branch to the prod branch. This process will be used in the demonstration as well, so instead of manually making the changes, lets practice doing a pull request. Click the Pull requests link at the top of the GitHub page. Click the New pull request button. Change the base repository field from IBM/satellite-config-example to your GitHub fork of the repository. Select your repository fork!!! Change the base field from main to config-sample-prod and the compare field from main to config-sample-dev . This will tell GitHub to pull all changes in the dev branch into the prod branch. Verify the pull request can be merged, and click Create pull request . Enter a comment for the request and click Create pull request . Review the changes that are being made with the pull request and click Merge pull request . Click Confirm merge to perform the merging of the dev and prod branches. Verify the changes in the prod branch. Click the <> Code link and then change the branch pulldown menu to config-sample-prod . Notice the status above the table. It should reflect the recent merge of the pull request. You can also view the changes to each file by clicking the deployments directory and viewing the individual YAML files. To summarize, at this point you have copied (forked) sample code from one GitHub repository to your personal repository and updated the associated YAML files that will be used to deploy the sample application for both the dev and prod branches. In the next section, learn how to provision IBM Cloud Satellite and IBM Cloud Satellite enabled IBM Cloud services.","title":"Setup GitHub repository"},{"location":"2provisioning/02.01%20Locations/","text":"The first step to utilize IBM Cloud Satellite is to create a Location . A Location is a representation of an environment in a client's choice of infrastructure, such as an on-premises data center or public cloud. Below is a high-level architectural view of a Satellite Location. Creating a Satellite Location can be achieved through the IBM Cloud Portal, via the IBM Cloud Satellite command line interfaces, or application programming interfaces (APIs). For other public cloud providers, IBM Cloud Satellite provides automation via IBM Cloud Schematics to set up the Location. For on-premises deployments, scripts are provided that will need to be executed on each of the target host machines. Planning for the creation of a Location is critical. Detailed planning information is provided in the IBM Cloud Satellite documentation in the Planning your environment for Satellite section. There are many requirements associated with creating a Satellite Location including minimum host requirements, and minimum network latency between Satellite Location hosts and IBM Cloud data centers. Note: the physical location of the Satellite Location is not an attribute of the Location. It is a good practice to use the physical location in the Satellite Location name or tags. To learn more about Satellite Locations, refer to the Satellite Location product documentation: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-locations . The image below is from the IBM Cloud Portal . There are tiles that provide a wizard-based creation process for 3rd party cloud providers as well as on-premises, edge, and advanced configurations. Provisioning a location in 3rd party cloud provider The Terraform-based creation wizards for 3rd party cloud providers first prompt users for credentials for the users account in the 3rd party cloud. An example is shown below for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Once credentials are provided, prompts are provided for completing the required information to provision the Location. These include: The data center or region in the 3rd party provider where the Location should be created. The number and hardware configuration (CPU, Memory, Storage) of the virtual servers that will be provisioned ofr the location. And the IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket that will used to store information about the Location. The video below shows the provisioning of an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS. The video has been edited to minimize the viewing time and does not reflect the actual provisioning time of a Satellite Location. The actual provisioning time (from clicking \"Create location\" to the Location being ready) will vary. When this video was created, it took approximately 25 minutes for the 12 hosts to be provisioned in AWS and configured as a Satellite Location. Use this video to understand the talking points you can use with a client when describing the provisioning process. Tip If the video appears blurry, click the fullscreen or icon. On-premises or edge Provisioning a Location in a client's datacenter or edge location is accomplished through customized scripts. These scripts can be run manually or incorporated in automation tools like Schematics. Once all the planning is complete and hardware that meets the required Satellite specifications is available, the high-level process to create a Location is: Create the Location using the IBM Cloud Portal or command line interface Generate and download the host attach script using the IBM Cloud Portal or command line interface Copy and run the host attach script on each local physical or virtual server Assign hosts to the location control pane Assign additional hosts to various satellite-enabled services (e.g RedHat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, Cloud Object Storage, Event Streams, etc.) A more detailed explanation of these steps can be found here in the product documentation. More about the ITZ environment used in this activity As mentioned earlier, this activity utilizes a shared, pre-provisioned IBM Cloud Satellite Location. This environment is deployed on a set of VMware-based virtual servers that are actually running in a IBM Cloud for VMware vCenter Server (VCS) environment. This deployment model is only supported for testing purposes, however, it mimics one of the most common deployment models for IBM Cloud Satellite which is a set of VMware-based virtual machines running in a client's datacenter. The pre-provisioned Location used for this activity is located in the ITZ Cloud account called 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite and is called yl-l3-vmware . To view the Location details, follow these steps: Login to the IBM Cloud portal here: https://cloud.ibm.com . Once authenticated, change to the 2435442 - ITZ - Satellite . Navigate to the Satellite Location page by clicking the hamburger menu icon at top left, selecting Satellite and then Locations . Locate and click on the yl-l3-vmware in the Locations table. Finding the correct location This ITZ cloud account is used by many different ITZ environments. If the yl-l3-vmware location is not visible in the table, use the table's search or sort feature to find it. Explore the details of the Location including the Overview and Hosts views. On the Hosts page, click the Attach host + button. Here is where administrators come to generate and download the shell script to add hosts to the location. This is done when provisioning the control plane as well as additional servers needed for cloud-enabled services. Download and explore the attach host script ( Required for technical sellers only ).

In the future, more services will be enabled for IBM Cloud Satellite. For a full list of Satellite-enabled services, user the IBM Cloud Portal as described below, or check out the documentation page Supported Satellite-enabled IBM Cloud services . To successfully deploy any satellite-enabled service, hosts must be available and unassigned at the Location. As seen in the previous chapter about Locations, all the hosts at the **yl-l3-vmware are already assigned either to the Location control plane, or a already deployed Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster. Continuing from the previous chapter on Locations, in the steps below, explore how Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is deployed to a Location. Click the Services link on the yl-l3-vmware page in the IBM Cloud Portal Review the already deployed services, and then click the Create services + button. Review the list of available services, and then click the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud tile. Explore the Red Hat OpenShift cluster provisioning page in the IBM Cloud Portal. The image above is only part of the provisioning page. Notice how the Satellite tile under the Infrastructure section, the Resource group , and the yl-l3-vmware Location under the Locations section have been pre-selected. Scroll down to see the other parameters required to provision the OpenShift cluster. Notice the Minimum host requirements are not met warning. This is identifying the fact no unassigned hosts are available in the yl-l3-vmware . If unassigned hosts were available for the specified worker pool configuration, the Create button at the far right of the page would be enabled. Continue to scroll further in the dialog. Take special notice of the Satellite Config section. Satellite Config will be covered in more detail later in this guide. For now, note that in order to use Satellite Config to deploy Kubernetes resources to the cluster, it must be enabled at the time the cluster is created or a manual script must be run later. As mentioned earlier, an OpenShift cluster has already been deployed to the yl-l3-vmware Location. The deployment of the cluster took approximately 30 minutes.

The product documentation provides detailed guidance on host network requirements, outbound connectivity from the Location datacenter to IBM Cloud, and additional details. To learn more, start here . IBM Cloud Satellite Link endpoints provide controls for network traffic to and from a Satellite Location and services, servers, and/or applications that run outside of the Location. With Satellite Link endpoints , you can allow software that runs in your Satellite location to connect to a service, server, or application that runs outside of the Satellite Location. Links can also allow software that is connected to the IBM Cloud private network to connect to a service, server, or application that runs in your Satellite Location. To establish the connection, you must specify the destination resource's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address, port, the connection protocol, and any authentication methods at the endpoint. The endpoint is registered with the Satellite Link component of your Location's Satellite control plane. To help maintain enterprise security and audit compliance, Satellite Link endpoints provide additional built-in controls to restrict client access to endpoints, and to log and audit traffic that flows over endpoints. While Satellite Links are not used in explicitly used in the demonstration guidance provided in this activity, there are Link endpoints defined in the shared ITZ environment, and are an important concept to understand. For more information on Links, read the documentation here . In the following steps, learn more about Link endpoints . If not already open in a browser, return to the Location details page by clicking here . Click Link endpoints in the left-hand navigation pane. Review the Integrations that are available between IBM Cloud Satellite and IBM Cloud logging, monitoring, and event tracking services. Note, access to these integrated services is not provided in this shared ITZ environment. These are used by ITZ to monitor the health of the environment. However, the availability of these integrations is a critical benefit of IBM Cloud Satellite for clients and provide logging, monitoring, and event tracking capabilities the most clients will expect. Click the System endpoints tab. Review the configured System endpoints . These endpoints control access between the Satellite Location and other IBM Cloud services like logging, monitoring, and IBM Cloud Object Storage. Notice the 2 different values under Destination type in the table. Cloud endpoint By default, source clients in a Satellite location cannot reach destination resources that run outside of the location because the destination resource's IP address is not routable from within the location. A Cloud endpoint enables resources running in the Location to reach outside resources. Location endpoint By default, source clients that are connected to the IBM Cloud private network cannot reach destination resources that run in a Satellite Location because the destination resource's IP address is not routable from outside the location. Location endpoints allow outside resources to reach resources running inside the Location.
