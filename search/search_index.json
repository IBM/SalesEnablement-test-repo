Since, the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions portfolio has added several new offerings including:</p> <ul> <li> <p>VMware as a Service (VMwaaS) - Single-tenant</p> </li> <li> <p>VMware as a Service (VMwaaS) - Multitenant</p> </li> <li> <p>Cyber Recovery</p> </li> <li> <p>VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)</p> </li> </ul> <p>The plan is to phase out the VMware Shared offering in 2024/2025. Given that direction, this Level 3 has been updated to include  VMwaaS and VCF modules. The VMware Shared module is now optional. Not all of the videos have been updated and some will reference VMware Shared and VMware Dedicated. The Stand and Deliver requirements for IBM employees and the business partner quiz have been updated to reflect these changes. </p> <p>Note, images and videos in this demonstration guide may not reflect the latest changes in the IBM Cloud portal.</p> <p></p> <p>Welcome to the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions - Level 3 course and demonstration guide! The goal is to provide IBMers and Business Partner sellers the knowledge and tools to demonstrate the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions offerings.</p> <p>This course is not intended to serve as an in-depth study of VMware-specific topics; rather the focus is on the IBM Cloud aspects of the offerings. Numerous links and pointers to more content around VMware-specific features are included in each of the modules of this course.</p> <p>Most modules include recordings and narrated instructions. Be sure to watch these videos for a visual demonstration of how to use the hands-on lab components. The videos are useful in creating and recording your Stand &amp; Deliver presentations for Level 3 accreditation.</p> <p>ACCREDITATION</p> <p>To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills that are learned throughout the various modules. Level 3 accreditation requirements and the way participants are evaluated differ depending on job role.</p> <p>Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz upon completing the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active during the quiz. Watch for the \"BP quiz question\"  icon in the demonstration guide.</p> <p>IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a Stand &amp; Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client. IBMers have the flexibility to define a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording must be a demonstration and pitch the value of the IBM solution by using the environments and techniques of this lab.</p> <p>Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand &amp; Deliver recordings are provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning. Before continuing to the next module, read the guidance that follows. Your comprehension of the information outlined will save you time while completing the lab work.</p> <p>FIND HELP</p> <p>If at any point during the hands-on material you need help from the team of authors and other IBM experts, connect with the team in the #cloud-platform-demo-feedback Slack channel. Any comments or suggestions are also welcome in this channel.</p>"},{"location":"#_1","title":"Welcome","text":""},{"location":"#navigating-the-lab-guide","title":"Navigating the Lab Guide","text":"<p>The Level 3 demonstration guide is organized into four chapters, covering the <code>VMware as a Service</code>, <code>VMware vCenter Server</code>, <code>VMware Cloud Foundation</code>, and <code>VMware Shared</code> offerings of the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions portfolio.

Two options are available:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Routed: A network type that uses an edge gateway to enable controlled access to networks and systems external to (outside of) the VDC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Isolated: A network type that is only accessible by a specific VDC (or associated VDC Groups), thereby providing a fully isolated environment.</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Select the Routed Network Type.</p> </li> <li> <p>When satisfied, click Next to continue.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Having selected the Routed network type earlier, now define an Edge Connection for the organization VDC. The configuration tool automatically designates an edge connection (<code>edge-dal12-d625b1f2</code> for the <code>Dallas Director 01</code> data center) with <code>2</code> External Networks and <code>0</code> Org VDC Networks.</li> </ol> <p>Next, you must choose the type of Edge Connection to be applied. There are three options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Internal: For connecting to one of the edge gateway's internal interfaces. The maximum number of supported network connections is <code>9</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributed: For connecting with fast and efficient East-West routing. The network is connected to an internal interface of a distributed router that is exclusively associated with this gateway. The maximum number of supported network connections is <code>400</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Subinterface: For connecting to the edge gateway's internal trunk interface. The maximum number of supported network connections is <code>200</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li>Select the Internal Edge Connection type. When satisfied, click Next to continue.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Provide a unique Name for the organization VDC network (<code>se-l3-network</code>) and optionally a basic Description to its purpose.</li> </ol> <p>A Gateway CIDR must be assigned, which includes the IP address of the gateway. This value cannot be changed once assigned.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Assign a CIDR of <code>192.168.1.1/24</code> and leave the Dual-Stack Mode option disabled. In this deployment, the network is not to be Shared: therefore, leave this option disabled.</p> </li> <li> <p>When satisfied, click Next to continue.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Static IP Pools must now be assigned to the Gateway CIDR assigned earlier in Step 25. Verify that the CIDR displayed on this panel matches the one that you designated previously. No additional modifications are required.</p> <ol> <li>When satisfied, click Next to continue.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>DNS, or the Domain Name System, provides the mapping between IP addresses (such as the ones specified earlier) and the \"name\" address that you typically enter in a web browser (<code>www.google.com</code>, for example). A DNS relay can be enabled for the edge gateway previously configured; however, the DNS relay must be set before deployment and cannot be modified after the fact.</p> <ol> <li>Enable the Use Edge DNS slider. Note: this step is not shown as part of the Click-thru demonstration.</li> </ol> <p>The remaining fields below can remain blank. When satisfied, click Next to continue.</p> <p></p> <p>The Ready to Complete panel provides a full summary of your organization VDC network configurations. Review the details of the network before choosing to commit to a deployment, or discard the network configuration completely.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Finish button to create the network.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Your browser will automatically redirect to the Networking tab of the vCloud Director console. From the list of Networks, see the <code>se-l3-network</code> deploy and eventually update its status to <code>Ready</code> when fully initialized.</p> <ol> <li>Click the Virtual Machines subdirectory from the list of tabs along the left side of the interface.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The console's Applications dashboard allows for the centralized management and deployment of all applications\u2014 which are categorized as either virtual machines or virtual applications \u2014within the VMware Shared environment. A virtualized application, or vApp, consists of one or more virtual machines (VMs). The vApp communicates over the Shared plan's network, making use of the Shared plan's resources, or starting services that the Shared plan supports. A single vApp can consist of one, or multiple VMs.</p> <ol> <li>Try creating a new virtual machine from scratch. Click New VM in the menu at the bottom of the page.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>A new configuration window opens. Provide a Name (<code>se-l3-TestVM</code>) and Computer Name (<code>se-l3-testvm</code>), and an optional Description, for the new VM.</p> </li> <li> <p>The VM can either be crafted from scratch (New) or from a pre-designed template (From Template). One of the advantages of the VMware Shared plan on IBM Cloud is the wealth of templates available out of the box with the offering. Select the From Template option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable the Power Off toggle, as we do not want to initialize the VM until making other configuration changes in a later step.</p> </li> <li> <p>We recommend selecting the <code>vm-centos8</code> template, which corresponds to the CentOS 8 (64-Bit) official release, for the purposes of this demonstration \u2014 although you are free to choose any of your liking. Continue scrolling down the page to reveal more configuration options.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Storage for the VM is our next consideration. As described earlier in the Provisioning module, there are a variety of storage options available for virtual machines and virtual applications deployed within the VMware Shared environment. Each storage tier provides different levels of throughput (IOPs) and levels of isolation (multi-tenant versus single-tenant), with differing levels of billable rates and charges associated with each tier. For our purposes, we recommend the <code>Standard (VDC Default)</code> tier of Storage Policy.</p> <p>Compute is dictated by the VDC sizing configuration that was set during the Provisioning module. The resources available to the VM we are defining here are restricted by the hardware configurations assigned to the VDC when it was deployed earlier.</p> <p>NICs, or Network Interface Cards, provide the network interface needed by the virtual machine for communication with the public internet, IBM Cloud, and on-premises resources.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Primary NIC will have been configured by default, but additional modifications are needed before we can continue. Ensure the Connected field is toggled <code>ON</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Set the Network field to the network configuration deployed earlier: <code>se-l3-network</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Set the IP Mode to <code>DHCP</code></p> </li> <li> <p>When satisfied, click the OK button at the bottom of the panel to deploy the VM (which will remain powered off for now) and return to the Virtual Machines overview dashboard.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Locate the newly-minted VM tile on the page and click the Details button to inspect it further.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Let's reconfigure the guest operating system (OS) associated with the VM. Once inside the Details panel, click the Guest OS Customization subdirectory from the interface on the left side of the panel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Locate the Edit button, as shown in the screenshot below, and click the URL to open a new pop-up configuration window.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>You will want to set your own password for the guest OS. Therefore, DISABLE the Auto Generate Password toggle.</p> </li> <li> <p>ENABLE the Require Administrator to change password on first login option \u2014 this will prompt you to create a new password for the guest OS upon first connecting to the VM (once powered on).</p> </li> <li> <p>When satisfied, click Save to confirm the selections and return to the VM summary panel.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>From the interface along the top of the panel, select the All Actions drop-down.</p> </li> <li> <p>Drill down into Power and select the Power On, Force Customization option to initialize the newly-configured VM.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>The VM will take a moment to initialize and power on. Once ready, click the Launch Web Console button from the top of the panel.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>An SSH console will appear in a pop-up window. Enter <code>root</code> as your login ID and then enter any password. You will initially receive a warning that the password provided is incorrect, and then subsequently will be asked to create a new password for the login. This is a result of the configuration options set in Step 44. Enter a new password of your choosing (confirming the password a second time when asked to do so) and continue logging in to the VM console.</p> </li> <li> <p>After successfully connecting to the console, safely close the pop-up window and return to the vCloud Director web interface.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Once again, select the All Actions drop-down from the top of the panel's interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>Drill down into Power and click the the Power Off button to disable the VM.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Take note that the Power On and Power Off buttons have updated to reflect the VM status.

Clusters can only have hosts with homogeneous profiles. While it is possible to create clusters that use different host profiles, it is not recommended. VDCs deployed to a PVDC can use all compute, memory, and storage within the PVDC, including when multiple clusters exist. To get consistent workload performance, it is best if all clusters within the same PVDC use the same host profile type. VMware Cloud Director automatically selects and adjusts the placement of workload VMs across the clusters in the PVDC. Placement is not controlled by users or administrators with VMware Cloud Director. All clusters are combined within a PVDC with no fine grain control for workload placement. </p> <p>A new PVDC is typically created for the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Separate and isolate different types of workloads. If different workloads are better suited for different host types, then separate PVDCs are required to ensure each workload runs on the correct host type.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run workloads in different data centers within the region. All clusters in the same PVDC must be in the same data center. Regional high availability across data centers is achieved by creating PVDCs in separate data centers, and then deploying the virtual data center (VDC) and applications into each region.

Clients must ensure that the remaining clusters have compatible storage performance layers of the deleted cluster. The remaining clusters must also have enough CPU and memory to contain the VMs of the deleted cluster.</p> <p>If not enough CPU, RAM, or equivalent storage for the cluster exists, the delete operation does not succeed.
