Since, the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions portfolio has added several new offerings including VMware as a Service (VMwaaS) and Cyber Recovery . In the near future VMwaaS will support both single-tenant (available today) and multi-tenant capabilities. When the multi-tenant capability is available, the plan is to phase out the VMware Shared offering. Given that direction, this Level 3 has been updated to include a VMwaaS module and the VMware Shared module is now optional. The Stand and Deliver requirements for IBM employees and the business partner quiz have been updated to reflect these changes. Note, images and videos in this demonstration guide may not reflect the latest changes in the portal. Welcome to the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions - Level 3 course and demonstration guide! The goal is to provide Sellers and Technical Sellers, including both IBMers and Business Partners, with the knowledge and tools to perform click-thru demonstrations of the VMware as a Service , VMware Dedicated , and optionally, VMware Shared offerings. This course is not intended to serve as a deep dive into VMware-specific topics; rather the focus is on the IBM Cloud aspects of the offerings. Numerous links and pointers to additional content around VMware-specific features are included in each of the modules of this course. Most modules are accompanied by recordings and narrated instructions, delivered by your team of authors. Be sure to watch these for a visual demonstration of how to perform the hands-on lab components. In particular, it is strongly recommended that IBM Sellers and Technical Sellers watch these recordings \u2014 they will be useful for you as you go about creating and recording your own Stand & Deliver presentations for Level 3 accreditation. ACCREDITATION To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements\u2014 and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation \u2014differs depending on job role. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz. Watch for the \"BP quiz question\" icon in the demonstration guide. IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course.

There are two solution types: VMware vCenter Server and VMware vSphere. vCenter Server is a fully automated, standardized VMware software\u2013defined data center while VMware vSphere offers more customization of VMware components and licensing. Both solutions provide the option to purchase IBM-provided licenses or to bring your own license (BYOL). Note, this demonstration script is only focused on the VMware vCenter Server (VCS) offering. VCS is a hosted private cloud that delivers the VMware vSphere stack as a service. The VMware environment is built on top of a minimum of three IBM Cloud bare metal servers, shared file-level storage or dedicated VMware vSAN storage, and it includes the automatic deployment and configuration of an easy to manage logical edge firewall that is powered by VMware NSX. The entire environment can be provisioned in a matter of hours, and the elastic bare metal infrastructure can scale out the compute capacity rapidly when needed. IBM Cloud provides clients with full, native root access to the VMware ESXi hosts, NSX Manager, and the centralized platform for management, vCenter Server. Workloads can be moved to and from the cloud without changing the applications, tools, scripts, or investing in new skills. Platform instances and expansion nodes are priced per month and they include access to IBM Support and all VMware components that comprise the service. In the following modules, you will: Explore the process of provisioning a VCS instance via the IBM Cloud portal. Explore using the IBM Cloud portal to manage a VCS instance.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Dedicated/Managing/","text":"Now it is time to manage the VMware vCenter Server (VCS) instance. Use the click-thru demonstration below to practice managing a VCS instance. Tip Not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen and the spot to click next will be highlighted. Open the link below and then click the play button to begin the demonstration. Click-thru demo: Manage an instance of IBM Cloud VMware Solutions Dedicated Click the VMware icon in the left hand menu bar. Click the Resources option in left hand menu. Click the vCenter Server option under Resources in left hand menu. Click the vcs-l3 entry in the list of VCS instances. Click the Actions pulldown menu at top right. Click the Delete instance option. Read the information provided regarding deleting a VCS instance. Click the Cancel button. Click the Infrastructure option in left hand menu. Click the vcs-dv-consolidated entry in the list of clusters. Recall from the provisioning click-thru demonstration that a three node converged cluster was created. From this page hosts can be added and removed from the cluster. Click the Add button to add a host. Notice the options for adding a host to the existing cluster. In addition to specifying the number of hosts to add, the bare metal server configuration can be specified. As a best practice, all hosts in a cluster should be homogeneous, that is, they should all have the same bare metal configuration. Thus, the default is to utilize the same configuration as the existing hosts. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to provision hosts of a different flavor. These could include the need to have hosts with more memory or performance, the need to move off of configurations going out of support, etc. In these circumstances, the best practice is to provision all the new hosts, and then de-provision the old hosts allowing VMware to automatically move workloads from the old to the new hosts. Click the vcs-dv-consolidated link at the top of the page. Click the Add button for Storage . Notice additional storage shares can be added to the cluster. Shares can be added using any of the performance settings: 0.25, 2, 4, or 10 input/output operations per second per gigabyte (IOPS/GB). Click the vcs-dv-consolidated link at the top of the page. Click the View resource link next to Private VLAN in the Network interface section. Take a minute to review the details of the Private VLAN that was created when the cluster was created. Click anywhere on the screen to return to the cluster overview page. Click the Infrastructure option in left hand menu. Click the Add button. Recall, when originally provisioned, this VCS instance was created with a single consolidate cluster for both the VMware management, workloads, and edge services. From this page, new workload and edge services clusters can be added to the existing VCS instance. The information required and steps to complete the configuration of the additional workloads are very similar to when the original cluster was provisioned. Notice, new workload clusters can be provisioned in different IBM Cloud data centers with different bare metal server configurations. This flexibility allows client scenarios like: production workloads run on high performance clusters and test workloads run on lower cost, lower performance clusters highly available (HA) workloads across geographic regions disaster recovery (DR) Click the Edge services cluster radio button.

IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Shared is built around three key pillars: Cost-effective scalability : customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow should they require additional resources over time (or need to contract to fewer resource commitments as their services find greater efficiencies). As a result, customers can minimize their unused capacity and save money. Instead of buying fixed-size virtual machines, clients can instead purchase compute capacity (as needed) and provision any number of virtual machines (of different sizes) within the capacity limit they set. Temporary migration, co-location, and burst : multi-site data centers can be consolidated within a single location by migrating workloads from different sources. Disaster recovery : a suite of pre-installed services\u2014 Veeam Availability Suite, Veeam Cloud Connect, and Zerto \u2014provide options for disaster recover of critical workloads, achieving recovery point objectives (RPOs) within seconds, and maintaining application consistency. The offering is ideal for enterprise clients that are currently operating VMware workloads on-premises, but need to adopt cloud as part of their digital transformation and modernization strategy. The automation and added support that is made available through an IBM Cloud deployment speeds the time to delivery and lowers the risks that would otherwise be present if a client attempted to \"roll their own\" cloud deployment. Furthermore, the infrastructure supported by IBM Cloud is competitively priced and managed by IBM \u2014 ensuring that capital expenditures stay low. The scalability of cloud supports a pathway to further growth and investment, as well: Shared plan customers needing additional capacity or dedicated infrastructure have the flexibility to license IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions Dedicated offerings on the same cloud, should they need it. Next Steps In the following modules, you will: Explore the process of provisioning a VMware Shared instance via the IBM Cloud. Delve deeper into various elements of the offering's management console, including: data centers, applications, virtual machines, networking, libraries, administration, and system monitoring.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Shared/Introduction/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Shared/Introduction/#ibm-cloud-for-vmware-solutions-shared-is-built-around-three-key-pillars","text":"Cost-effective scalability : customers pay for what they use, with the option to grow should they require additional resources over time (or need to contract to fewer resource commitments as their services find greater efficiencies).

Click-Thru Demonstration Click-thru demo: Managing an instance of IBM Cloud VMware Solutions Shared . Use the click-thru demonstration linked above to practice managing an instance of VMware Shared. The fields that require a text entry (e.g. service name) are pre-populated in the click-thru demonstration. Open the link and then click the play button to begin the demonstration. NAVIGATION Not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen within the click-thru demo page and the spot to interact with next will be highlighted. Step-by-step instructions on how to navigate the demo, and repeat the demonstration again in front of clients, are provided in the write-up below. Step-By-Step Instructions VMware Solutions, including the Shared plan and other tiers, are accessible through the VMware portal on IBM Cloud . Be aware that if you provision a live VMware Shared instance using your personal IBM Cloud account, then your account (and credit card associated with that personal account) will be billed for the deployment. From the IBM Cloud dashboard, click the VMware tab from the left hand navigation menu, or alternatively search for VMware Solutions in the search bar. Drill down into the Resources tab within the left hand navigation menu. From the variety of VMware Solutions plans available, click on the VMware Shared option. An instance of VMware Shared should already be set up, having completed the Provisioning section earlier. Locate the instance\u2014 Dallas Director 01 in the example screenshot below, although the naming of your instance may differ \u2014and click the name of the instance to pull open a Summary page. The browser will load a Summary panel for the VMware Shared instance, supplying details on access controls for your instance, virtual data centers associated with the deployment, and additional services that can be used in conjunction with the instance. Before you can connect to the VMware Shared instance, you need to set an administrative password for the vCloud Director console . Do so by clicking the Reset site admin password button as shown. A dialogue window will open, asking you to confirm an administrative password reset for the instance. Confirm the selection and wait for the reset to complete. The User name will always be set to admin by default. The Password will be uniquely generated each time a reset is conducted. Click the \"eyeball\" icon to view the password and the \"box\" icon to copy the password to your machine's clipboard. Record both of these values to a notepad \u2014 you will need to reference these later for connecting to the vCloud Director console. Click the Close button to continue. Note: the inspection and copy to clipboard steps are shown as a single interaction in the Click-thru demonstration. Locate the VMware Shared navigation link at the top left of the page. Click the URL to return to the overview page for all VMware Shared instances. Just to the left of the Dallas Director 01 instance is a drop-down arrow \u2014 click this arrow to expand the list of all Virtual Data Centers (VDC) belonging to that instance. There may multiple VDCs belonging to the Dallas Director 01 VMware Shared instance. In our example, click on the Name of the se-l3-shared VDC to pull open additional details. BP quiz question Take note of both VDC names that have been provisioned in Dallas Director 01 . Let's experiment with resizing the amount of vCPU and RAM resources assigned to the VDC. Recall earlier that it was mentioned how IBM Cloud enables scalable deployments of VMware Shared, which can be adjusted (up or down) as the resource requirements of the instance change over its lifecycle. Edit the Resource Reservation field by clicking the pencil icon, as shown below. Adjust the vCPU Limit field down to 50 vCPU and reduce the RAM Limit field to 5120 GB. BP quiz question Take note of the vCPU and RAM limits before they are changed. Take note that the metered billing for the instance will be adjusted based on the reduced resource requirements. When satisfied, click Modify to confirm and implement the changes. Back on the Summary page, locate the vCloud Director console button near the top right of the screen. Before resetting the admin password, this button would have been greyed out and inaccessible. With the password reset complete, the button is now active (blue) \u2014 click it to continue to the console login page. A new tab or window will open, prompting you to log in to the vCloud Director console. If one does not appear, check to make sure a pop-up blocker is not active. Use the admin and password fields recorded in Step 6 to log in to the console. Click Sign In to continue. After successfully authenticating, your browser will redirect to the vCloud Director console . From this page, you will be able to access many of the administrative functions for the VMware Shared environment (with some restrictions in place to ensure the safety and stability of the deployment). By default, the console will load to the Data Centers tab. Here you can inspect details on the virtual data center supporting your environment. A summary of the VDC's vCPU, memory, and storage utilization is provided at the bottom of the page. Let's drill down into the se-l3-shared VDC that was re-sized earlier by clicking the tile, as shown, in the dashboard. From this management screen, you can access information on the VMware Shared plan's available Networks , Edge Gateways , Data Center Groups , and Security Tags . Our first task will be to define Networking parameters for the VDC. Click the Networks subdirectory from the list of tabs along the left side of the interface. Click the New button, as shown in the screenshot below, to create a new network configuration for the VDC. A new page will load to guide you through the process of defining an organization-wide virtual data center (VDC) network. The first element to be defined is the overall Scope of the network. The Scope of the network can be constrained to either an organization-wide VDC (providing connectivity only across the virtual machines belonging to that particular VDC), or across a data center group (connectivity across all VDCs belonging to that group, inclusive of all VMs belonging to those VDCs). Select the Current Organization Virtual Data Center option to keep networking connectivity restricted to only this singular VDC ( se-l3-shared ). When satisfied, click Next to continue. You must now decide the Network Type appropriate for this deployment. There are two options: Routed : A network type that utilizes an edge gateway to enable controlled access to networks and machines external to (outside of) the VDC. Isolated : A network type that is only accessible by a specific VDC (or associated VDC Groups), thereby providing a fully isolated environment. Select the Routed Network Type. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Having selected the Routed network type earlier, which makes use of an edge gateway for regulated access to the network, we must now define an Edge Connection for the organization VDC. The configuration tool will automatically designate an edge connection ( edge-dal12-d625b1f2 for the Dallas Director 01 data center) with 2 External Networks and 0 Org VDC Networks. Next, you must choose the type of Edge Connection to be applied. There are three options: Internal : For connecting to one of the edge gateway's internal interfaces. The maximum number of supported network connections is 9 . Distributed : For connecting via fast and efficient East-West routing. The network will be connected to an internal interface of a distributed router that is exclusively associated with this gateway. The maximum number of supported network connections is 400 . Subinterface : For connecting to the edge gateway's internal trunk interface. The maximum number of supported network connections is 200 . Select the Internal Edge Connection type. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Provide a unique Name for the organization VDC network ( se-l3-network ) and optionally a basic Description to its purpose. A Gateway CIDR must be assigned, which includes the IP address of the gateway. This value cannot be changed once assigned. Assign a CIDR of 192.168.1.1/24 and leave the Dual-Stack Mode option disabled. For our purposes, the network is not to be Shared : therefore, leave this option disabled. When satisfied, click Next to continue. Static IP Pools must now be assigned to the Gateway CIDR assigned earlier in Step 25 . Verify that the CIDR displayed on this panel matches the one that you designated previously. No additional modifications are required at this time. When satisfied, click Next to continue. DNS , or the Domain Name System, provides the mapping between IP addresses (such as the ones specified earlier) and the \"name\" address that you typically enter into a web browser ( www.google.com , for example). A DNS relay can be enabled for the edge gateway previously configured; however, the DNS relay must be set before deployment and cannot be modified after the fact. Enable the Use Edge DNS slider. Note: this step is not shown as part of the Click-thru demonstration. The remaining fields below can remain blank. When satisfied, click Next to continue. The Ready to Complete panel provides a full summary of your organization VDC network configurations. Here you can review the details of the network before choosing to commit to a deployment, or discard the network configuration completely. Click the Finish button to create the network. Your browser will automatically redirect to the Networking tab of the vCloud Director console. From the list of Networks, you will see the se-l3-network deploy and eventually update its status to Ready once fully initialized. Click the Virtual Machines subdirectory from the list of tabs along the left side of the interface. The console's Applications dashboard allows for the centralized management and deployment of all applications\u2014 which are categorized as either virtual machines or virtual applications \u2014within the VMware Shared environment. A virtualized application, or vApp , consists of one or more virtual machines (VMs) that communicate over the Shared plan's network, making use of the Shared plan's resources, or invoking services that the Shared plan supports. A single vApp can consist of one, or multiple, VMs as part of its backbone. Let's try drafting a new virtual machine from scratch. Do so by clicking the New VM button from the menu at the bottom of the page. A new configuration window will open. Provide a Name ( se-l3-TestVM ) and Computer Name ( se-l3-testvm ), as well as an optional Description , for the new VM. The VM can either be crafted from scratch ( New ) or from a pre-designed template ( From Template ). One of the advantages of the VMware Shared plan on IBM Cloud is the wealth of templates available out of the box with the offering. Select the From Template option. Disable the Power Off toggle, as we do not want to initialize the VM until making additional configuration changes in a later step. We recommend selecting the vm-centos8 template, which corresponds to the CentOS 8 (64-Bit) official release, for the purposes of this demonstration \u2014 although you are free to choose any of your liking. Continue scrolling down the page to reveal more configuration options. Storage for the VM is our next consideration. As described earlier in the Provisioning module, there are a variety of storage options available for virtual machines and virtual applications deployed within the VMware Shared environment. Each storage tier provides different levels of throughput (IOPs) and levels of isolation (multi-tenant versus single-tenant), with differing levels of billable rates and charges associated with each tier. For our purposes, we recommend the Standard (VDC Default) tier of Storage Policy . Compute is dictated by the VDC sizing configuration that was set during the Provisioning module. The resources available to the VM we are defining here are restricted by the hardware configurations assigned to the VDC when it was deployed earlier. NICs , or Network Interface Cards, provide the network interface needed by the virtual machine for communication with the public internet, IBM Cloud, and on-premises resources. The Primary NIC will have been configured by default, but additional modifications are needed before we can continue. Ensure the Connected field is toggled ON Set the Network field to the network configuration deployed earlier: se-l3-network Set the IP Mode to DHCP When satisfied, click the OK button at the bottom of the panel to deploy the VM (which will remain powered off for now) and return to the Virtual Machines overview dashboard. Locate the newly-minted VM tile on the page and click the Details button to inspect it further. Let's reconfigure the guest operating system (OS) associated with the VM. Once inside the Details panel, click the Guest OS Customization subdirectory from the interface on the left side of the panel. Locate the Edit button, as shown in the screenshot below, and click the URL to open a new pop-up configuration window. You will want to set your own password for the guest OS. Therefore, DISABLE the Auto Generate Password toggle. ENABLE the Require Administrator to change password on first login option \u2014 this will prompt you to create a new password for the guest OS upon first connecting to the VM (once powered on). When satisfied, click Save to confirm the selections and return to the VM summary panel. From the interface along the top of the panel, select the All Actions drop-down. Drill down into Power and select the Power On, Force Customization option to initialize the newly-configured VM. The VM will take a moment to initialize and power on. Once ready, click the Launch Web Console button from the top of the panel. An SSH console will appear in a pop-up window. Enter root as your login ID and then enter any password. You will initially receive a warning that the password provided is incorrect , and then subsequently will be asked to create a new password for the login. This is a result of the configuration options set in Step 44 . Enter a new password of your choosing (confirming the password a second time when asked to do so) and continue logging in to the VM console. After successfully connecting to the console, safely close the pop-up window and return to the vCloud Director web interface. Once again, select the All Actions drop-down from the top of the panel's interface. Drill down into Power and click the the Power Off button to disable the VM. Take note that the Power On and Power Off buttons have updated to reflect the VM status. For a third time, select the All Actions drop-down from the panel's interface. Click the Delete button to tear down the VM instance. Confirm the selection when prompted to do so. Close the vCloud Director web dashboard and return to the IBM Cloud dashboard. From the drop-down in the top right corner of the interface (as shown in the screenshot below), click the Actions button. Note: this step, and Step 56 and Step 57 , is not shown as part of the Click-thru demonstration. Select the Monitoring button to open the IBM Cloud monitoring dashboard for the VMware Shared instance. From the Monitoring tab it is possible for administrative users to inspect running Tasks and Events across the instance. Explore the interface and use the filters along the bottom of the page to look across activity for the environment across different ranges of time. At this point in time, you have successfully explored the myriad of features and management tools available from within the VMware Shared dashboard on IBM Cloud. You should now have greater familiarity and fluency with the various elements of the management panels and tooling, including: how to manage data centers, building applications and virtual machines through the guided web interface, establishing networking rules, and the wealth of tooling available for managing the environment once in production.

Click-Thru Demonstration Click-thru demo: Provision an instance of IBM Cloud VMware Solutions Shared . We begin by simulating how to provision a VMware Shared instance. Use the click-thru demonstration linked above to practice the provisioning process. The fields that require a text entry (e.g. service name) are pre-populated in the click-thru demonstration. Open the link and then click the play button to begin the demonstration. NAVIGATION Not sure where to click or what to do next? Simply click anywhere on the screen within the click-thru demo page and the spot to interact with next will be highlighted. Step-by-step instructions on how to navigate the demo, and repeat the demonstration again in front of clients, are provided in the write-up below. Step-By-Step Instructions VMWare Solutions, including the Shared plan and other tiers, are accessible through the VMware portal on IBM Cloud . Be aware that if you provision a live VMware Shared instance using your personal IBM Cloud account, then your account (and credit card associated with that personal account) will be billed for the deployment. From the IBM Cloud dashboard, click the VMware tab on the left hand navigation menu, or alternatively Search for VMware Solutions in the search bar at the top of the page. Switch to your personal IBM Cloud account, or an account that you have permission to charge billable expenses to, by clicking the drop-down selector in the top right corner of the IBM Cloud interface. Note: this step is not shown as part of the Click-thru demonstration. With your account properly set, you can proceed with configuration and setup of a VMware Shared plan. There are four flavors currently provided for VMware on IBM Cloud: VMware Shared , VMware as a Service , VMware vSphere , and VMware vCenter Server . For the purposes of this module, you will be provisioning and configuring a VMware Shared instance. As shown in the screenshot below, select the VMware Shared tile and click Create to continue to the configuration page. The web browser will redirect to a new page, where you will be asked to provide detailed configuration options for various elements of the VMware Shared instance that IBM Cloud is to deploy. Pricing Plans ON-DEMAND VS. RESERVED Two tiers of pricing plan are available for any VMware Shared virtual data center environment: on-demand or reserved . On-demand allocates virtual data center virtual CPU (vCPU) and RAM as needed. The amount of time that the allocation requires will depend upon the global demand (usage) of the virtual data center vCPU and RAM for the region in which the Shared plan is deployed. Allocations of vCPU and RAM, therefore, are scalable and can be adjusted over time. The price is calculated hourly and it is based on the resource usage in the virtual data center. Reserved pre-allocates the vCPU and RAM virtual data center reservations at deployment time and their availability afterwards is guaranteed; this contrasts sharply with on-demand deployments, where availability is a best-effort guarantee (but not at a certainty \u2014 as demand across the infrastructure region in which it is deployed may ebb and flow over time). The price is calculated monthly for the full duration of the reservation and it is based on the allocation size of the virtual data center. Select the On-Demand pricing plan. ADJUSTING COSTS Take note that the Summary panel at the far-right side of the IBM Cloud dashboard dynamically updates as you adjust configuration options on this page. Try out various options along the way to preview how these features impact the cost of a VMware Shared deployment. You can also read more about pricing within the About tab. Supply a unique and memorable Virtual data center name for your environment, such as se-l3-shared . Set the Resource Group to Enablement-L3 . This determines how resources are organized within your IBM Cloud account. Resource Groups cannot be changed for a service instance once it has been deployed. You will not be able to set this value in the ITZ environment. If you are replicating these steps using your personal IBM Cloud account, you will likely see different Resource Groups available than the ones shown here. Deployment Topology SINGLE VS. MULTI-ZONE For every deployment of VMware Shared, there are two Topologies that a client may select from: single or multi-zone . A single zone VMware virtual data center deployment will provision the environment within a single availability center (easier to manage, but vulnerable to a single point of failure). A multi-zone VMware virtual data center deployment will deploy across two availability zones in an IBM Cloud multi-zone region, providing failover in the event that a single-zone data center failure occurs. Select the Single-zone VMware virtual data center topology. Geography should be set to the region located closest to your local area. Note: this step is not shown as part of the Click-thru demonstration. Use the default value selected for Site . Use the default value selected for Location . Note: for the Click-thru demonstration, you will be asked to inspect the Location options before cancelling back out to the main configuration page. Networking Types NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS VMware Shared on IBM Cloud supports two networking configurations: Public and Private or Private Only . The public network endpoints that are provisioned by default are the five public IP addresses that are displayed in the VMware Shared virtual data center details page. After the demonstration environment has provisioned, you will be able to go and inspect those for yourself. A private network endpoint allows a customer's IBM Cloud account devices or resources to connect to their virtual data centers by using the IBM Cloud private network. The private network endpoint service is available and ready to use in all virtual data centers provisioned through the IBM Cloud. Click the Networking tab from the sidebar. To give the environment the widest range of options, select the Public and Private Networking option from the configuration panel. ADVANCED EDGE GATEWAY By default, every virtual data center comes configured with one advanced edge gateway, with five public IP addresses and one private service IP address. The advanced edge gateway is configurable by a customer and can be tailored to their specific needs. Connections to private network endpoints do not require public internet access. A private network endpoint provides a unique IP address that is accessible to customers without the need for a VPN connection. Private network endpoints support one-way traffic from IBM Cloud account resources to the virtual machines in a customer's virtual data center. There are several considerations to take into account creating a private network for VMware Shared, or any private network connection on IBM Cloud in general. They are: If you have an IBM Cloud Direct Link on your account, you must establish a tunnel between the cross-connect router and the customer edge to have access to the virtual data center. You can order only one private network endpoint per single-zone virtual data centers. For multi-zone virtual data centers, two private network endpoints must be ordered to correspond with each NSX Edge Service Gateway. If you want to change the device type of your private network endpoint, you must first delete the existing private network endpoint. Then, create a new private network endpoint with the new device type. You can simultaneously make resource updates to your virtual data center while you create or delete a private network endpoint. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Dig deeper into how to define and manage private networks within IBM Cloud's online documentation: Viewing a private network endpoint for a virtual data center: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_viewing-endpoints Modifying a private network endpoint for a virtual data center: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_modifying-endpoints Deleting a private network endpoint from a virtual data center: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_deleting-endpoints Creating a private network endpoint: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-shared_creating-endpoints Virtual Data Center Capacity These values essentially determine the compute processing capacity that is allocated to your virtual data center. It is measured in vCPU increments. Each vCPU increment represents a single 2.0 GHz core. Compute memory, or \"RAM limit\" as it is described on the IBM Cloud portal, is allocated in one gigabyte (GB) increments. RAM limits identify the maximum amount of random access memory available to each virtual data center. The limit placed on the maximum vCPU values determines the total number of processing units available for each virtual data center. Similarly, the RAM limit sets the maximum amount of memory available. You can adjust either of these values after you provision the virtual data center \u2014 giving customers the ability to scale and grow (or scale down) their virtual date center over time. Set the value of vCPU Limit to 100 . Set the value of RAM Limit to 10240 . The least amount of vCPU that can be provisioned for any data center is 1 vCPU; RAM is likewise limited to a minimum of 1 GB. Obviously, in the case of a real-world demonstration environment (or a production environment), you will want to size these appropriately to the anticipated workloads that the virtual server will be subject to. Storage When creating or deploying vApps / VMs, customers can select either an unencrypted or encrypted storage policy. Each option has six different tiers of storage available, depending on the storage performance required, with each option carrying a maximum throughput of IOPS (input-output operations per second) per gigabyte. How you are billed for storage, and the types of storage policies used, only come into effect after you have started deploying vApps or VMs within your VMware Shared plan. As we are not deploying code as part of this hands-on material, it is not necessary for us to worry about storage configurations at this time. WHERE'S MY STORAGE? Storage policy availability can vary by region and deployment topology. To inspect further details on the storage options available for any VMware Shared configuration, click the About tab at the top of the IBM Cloud catalog page. Encryption-enabled storage policies are available to all virtual data centers. Encryption protects not only the VMs but also VM disks and other files. Administrators can encrypt VMs and disks by associating the VM or disk with a storage policy that has enabled VM-encryption capabilities. For more information about the VM encryption limitations for VMware Cloud Director 10.3, see Enabling VM encryption on storage policies of an Organization virtual data center . Pre-Installed Services There are three services pre-installed with every deployment of VMware Shared on IBM Cloud. While they are ready for activation at any time, they are not free to use \u2014 if a client wishes to make use of these services, they must agree to the terms of use license and incur the costs associated with that add-on service. If the pre-installed service is never activated or used, no additional charges will be leveed against the VMware Shared client. These services, as described, are pre-installed with every VMware Shared deployment on IBM Cloud. We will not be making use of these services for the purposes of this hands-on lab and as such they can be ignored for now. The pre-installed services include: Veeam Availability Suite : Veeam enables secure backups to VMware Shared workloads. It also packages capabilities for meeting recovery objectives, cloud-based disaster recovery backups, as well as monitoring and reporting capabilities. Veeam Cloud Connect Replication : Extends on-premises Veeam environments to IBM Cloud, providing a secure and resilient disaster recovery environment. Zerto : Replicates VMs between data centers in the public cloud, or between public cloud and on-premises data centers. After Placing An Order When satisfied with the configuration options, inspect the far-right side of the IBM Cloud interface to confirm your costs and agree to the terms of service. As mentioned before, be aware that provisioning a VMware Shared plan on IBM Cloud will result in billing to your personal account (and associated credit card personal credit card). Verify that you have read and agree to the terms of service. Click Create to initiate the deployment of the VMware Shared service on IBM Cloud. Once you click Confirm , the deployment of the resources starts automatically and a message will be displayed on the IBM Cloud interface explaining that the order is being processed. You can check the deployment status, including any issues that might require your attention, by viewing the Resources tab from the VMware Solutions dashboard . Return to the VMware Solutions dashboard and drill down into Resources > VMware Shared to monitor the progress of your deployment. Note: this step is not shown as part of the Click-thru demonstration. Once the resources have been successfully deployed, the components that are described within the technical specifications documentation for VMware Shared will be installed within your VMware virtual instance. When the resources are ready to use, the status will be changed to Ready . When ready, proceed to the Managing module of this hands-on documentation.","title":"Provisioning"},{"location":"Shared/Provisioning/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Shared/Provisioning/#click-thru-demonstration","text":"Click-thru demo: Provision an instance of IBM Cloud VMware Solutions Shared .

IBM does the configuration, hosting, operations, and lifecycle management of the VMware software so clients can quickly deploy their VMware-based cloud computing environments with simplified management and reduced costs. The architecture diagram illustrates both the separation of IBM Cloud clients (referred to as Customer in the diagram) and of the management responsibilities between IBM and clients. Please read! All sellers, especially technical sellers, should read the VMwaaS overview documentation found here . Additionally, while most of the underlying VMware products that are utilized in the offering are hidden from the end client, some clients may ask about the versions utilized. This information is available in the VMware as a Service release notes found here . Today, compute resources are available as single-tenant, dedicated hosts on IBM Cloud bare metal servers, with multiple host configurations available to address various workload requirements. Both Network File Storage (NFS) and VMware vSAN storage options are available, along with an ecosystem of enterprise-grade add-on services for backup, migration, and disaster recovery. As mentioned earlier, VMwaaS utilizes a shared responsibility model that includes IBM-managed infrastructure and IBM managed VMware components and services up to the hypervisor.

Not sure where to click or what to do next? Click anywhere on the screen within the click-thru demo page and the spot to interact with next is highlighted. Step-by-step instructions on how to run the demo follow. Step-by-step Instructions Read before continuing! VMware Solutions, including the VMwaaS and other offerings, are accessible through the VMware portal on IBM Cloud . For this Level 3 course, these steps are intended to be followed in the click-thru demonstration ; however, they can also be used to create a new instance. If you provision a live VMwaaS instance in your personal IBM Cloud account, then your account (and credit card that is associated with that account) is billed for the deployment. Your user ID does not have permissions to complete these steps in the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment associated with this course. These resources are already created in the ITZ environment. Provision a site (single-tenant) Open the click-thru demo and then click play to begin the demonstration. Click-thru demo: Provision an instance of VMwaaS Click the VMware ( ) icon in navigation menu. Click the VMware as a Service tile. A VMwaaS single-tenant site is a deployment of VMware vCloud Director on dedicated infrastructure. A virtual data center (VDC) is a logical data center that uses the infrastructure resources of a site . A site must be created before a VDC can be provisioned. A Provider Virtual Data Center (PVDC) is a grouping of compute and storage resources from a single VMware vCenter Server. A provider virtual data center consists of one or more resource pools (clusters) and one or more datastores. Click the Cloud Director Site tile. Click in the Name field. Specify a descriptive name for the Cloud Director site as it cannot be changed after the site is provisioned. Click the Resource Group drop-down menu. Resource groups are used to help manage resources and billing in an IBM Cloud account. Click the Enablement-L3 resource group. Click in the Provider Virtual Data Center (VDC) name field. Click the Dallas 12 in the Provider VDC location table. VMwaaS is not available in all IBM Cloud data centers. Always verify the current locations in the IBM Cloud portal or the documentation here . Click in the Cluster name field. A single-tenant site consists of one or more VMware vCenter clusters . Clusters are the building blocks of PVDCs. When initially provisioning a VMwaaS site, just one cluster can be provisioned. More clusters can be added later. A minimum of 2 hosts are required for NFS-only storage clusters. A minimum of 6 hosts are required for vSAN plus optional NFS storage clusters. All hosts in a cluster must be homogeneous in their configuration and must be chosen from the supported configurations. Supported configurations will change over time, consult the IBM Cloud portal or the documentation here for the current supported configurations. Hosts can be added and removed to increase and decrease capacity of the cluster. This capability will be explored in the next section of this demonstration guide. Click the vSAN + optional NFS storage radio button. VMwaaS supports both network file storage (NFS) and VMware vSAN (virtual Storage Area Network) storage. You can select NFS only storage or vSAN storage with optional NFS storage. vSAN with optional NFS storage is only available in IBM Cloud data centers with networks of 25 gigabits (GbE) bandwidth. vSAN clusters use bare metal host profiles with local flash storage. vSAN clusters can also use NFS storage. VWMare vSAN deduplication and compression are available to reduce redundant data within each disk group. This option can increase overall storage space based on the data type. Storage encryption is provided with unique IBM-managed encryption keys per instance with encrypted VMware storage profiles Click the NFS-only storage radio button. Important In this click-thru demo and in the associated ITZ environment, the VMwaaS site that is created is a NFS-only site. This option was chosen to reduce long-term costs of the environment. The vSAN provisioning options are explored in the click-thru demo, but a vSAN cluster is not provisioned or available in the ITZ environment. Click the + icon to add a 0.25 IOPS/GB NFS storage device. With NFS, clients can choose from 0.25, 2, 4, and 10 input/output operations per second per gigabyte (IOPS/GB) performance options. A minimum of one unit of 2 IOPS/GB or higher must be selected in NFS-only clusters. Click the Veeam Backup and Replication toggle button to disable the installation of Veeam. At the time this document was written, the only add-on service available at provisioning time was Veeam. To learn more about Veeam, go here . Veeam is not deployed for the demonstration. Click the I have read and agreed to the following license agreements checkbox. Click the Create button. The provisioning process is automated and includes provisioning the bare metal servers and deploying the VMware software stack. Provisioning time varies based on the number and configuration of the bare metal servers. When the ITZ environment used for this learning plan was originally created, the provisioning of the site took approximately 48 hours. Unfortunately longer than expected as the unofficial target is ~24 hours. Provision a virtual data center (single-tenant) When the provisioning process of the site is complete, the status turns from Creating to Available . When the site is available, a VDC can be created within the PVDC. Use the click-thru demo and these steps to learn about this process. Open the click-thru demo and then click play to begin the demonstration. Click-thru demo: Provision a virtual data center Click the Virtual data centers tab. Click Create new + Click the Virtual data center tile. Click in the Name field. Specify a descriptive name for the VCD as it cannot be changed after the site is provisioned. Click the Resource Group drop-down menu. Resource groups are used to help manage resources and billing in an IBM Cloud account. Click the Enablement-L3 resource group. Recall that a VDC must be associated with a site . Since only 1 site currently exists in this account, the Location , Cloud Director Site , and Provider Virtual Data Center fields are already populated and cannot be changed. If other sites or PVDCs were configured, the user would need to specify which ones to use. Click the Fast provisioning of VMs using linked clones toggle button. The Fast provisioning of VMs using linked clones option saves time by using linked clones for virtual machine provisioning. This option is enabled at the provider virtual data center (PVDC) level. Fast provisioning can be enabled for any VDCs created within the PVDC. If not enabled, all provisioning operations use full clones. To learn more about fast provisioning, check out VMware's documentation here . Click the Performance - M radio button in the Edge types table. VDCs connect to the public and IBM private networks through edges. Edges can also be used to connect multiple VDC networks together. Currently, four choices of edge types are supported, note the networking elements that can be enabled with each: Efficiency These edges allocate networking resources that can be used by up to 100 VDCs before another efficiency edge needs to be created. Processors and memory are used from the single tenant site. New edge storage is allocated at an extra cost. Subsequent VDCs, up to 100, can use this edge at no extra cost. This option is suitable for saving resources and costs with independent networking control per VDC. Performance - M This option is suitable when only Layer 2 (L2) through L4 features such as Network Address Translation (NAT), routing, L4 firewall, and L4 load balancers are required. This option is suitable when the total throughput requirement is less than two gigabits per second (Gbps). Performance - L This option is suitable when only L2 through L4 features such as NAT, routing, L4 firewall, and L4 load balancers are required. This option is suitable when the total throughput requirement is in the range of two to 10 Gbps. Performance - XL This option is suitable when the total throughput required is multiple Gbps for L7 and one or more virtual private networks (VPNs) are required.

Click-thru demo: Provision an instance of VMwaaS Click the VMware ( ) icon in navigation menu. Click the VMware as a Service tile. A VMwaaS single-tenant site is a deployment of VMware vCloud Director on dedicated infrastructure. A virtual data center (VDC) is a logical data center that uses the infrastructure resources of a site . A site must be created before a VDC can be provisioned. A Provider Virtual Data Center (PVDC) is a grouping of compute and storage resources from a single VMware vCenter Server. A provider virtual data center consists of one or more resource pools (clusters) and one or more datastores. Click the Cloud Director Site tile. Click in the Name field. Specify a descriptive name for the Cloud Director site as it cannot be changed after the site is provisioned. Click the Resource Group drop-down menu. Resource groups are used to help manage resources and billing in an IBM Cloud account. Click the Enablement-L3 resource group. Click in the Provider Virtual Data Center (VDC) name field. Click the Dallas 12 in the Provider VDC location table. VMwaaS is not available in all IBM Cloud data centers. Always verify the current locations in the IBM Cloud portal or the documentation here . Click in the Cluster name field. A single-tenant site consists of one or more VMware vCenter clusters . Clusters are the building blocks of PVDCs. When initially provisioning a VMwaaS site, just one cluster can be provisioned. More clusters can be added later. A minimum of 2 hosts are required for NFS-only storage clusters. A minimum of 6 hosts are required for vSAN plus optional NFS storage clusters. All hosts in a cluster must be homogeneous in their configuration and must be chosen from the supported configurations. Supported configurations will change over time, consult the IBM Cloud portal or the documentation here for the current supported configurations. Hosts can be added and removed to increase and decrease capacity of the cluster. This capability will be explored in the next section of this demonstration guide. Click the vSAN + optional NFS storage radio button. VMwaaS supports both network file storage (NFS) and VMware vSAN (virtual Storage Area Network) storage. You can select NFS only storage or vSAN storage with optional NFS storage. vSAN with optional NFS storage is only available in IBM Cloud data centers with networks of 25 gigabits (GbE) bandwidth. vSAN clusters use bare metal host profiles with local flash storage. vSAN clusters can also use NFS storage. VWMare vSAN deduplication and compression are available to reduce redundant data within each disk group. This option can increase overall storage space based on the data type. Storage encryption is provided with unique IBM-managed encryption keys per instance with encrypted VMware storage profiles Click the NFS-only storage radio button. Important In this click-thru demo and in the associated ITZ environment, the VMwaaS site that is created is a NFS-only site. This option was chosen to reduce long-term costs of the environment. The vSAN provisioning options are explored in the click-thru demo, but a vSAN cluster is not provisioned or available in the ITZ environment. Click the + icon to add a 0.25 IOPS/GB NFS storage device. With NFS, clients can choose from 0.25, 2, 4, and 10 input/output operations per second per gigabyte (IOPS/GB) performance options. A minimum of one unit of 2 IOPS/GB or higher must be selected in NFS-only clusters. Click the Veeam Backup and Replication toggle button to disable the installation of Veeam.

Now it is time to switch gears and use the VMware Cloud Director (vCloud Director or vCD) to provision virtual machines (VMs) to run the client's workloads. However, since most workloads consist of more than single machines that run isolated from other resources, some network configuration needs to be done first. In the next chapter, learn how the VMwaaS network in the ITZ demonstration environment was setup by stepping through one last click-thru demonstration.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"VMwaaS/Using/UsingVMwaaS/","text":"One of the many reasons clients consider VMware as a Service (VMwaaS) on IBM Cloud is for the ease of rapidly deploying virtual machines (VMs) to run their business workloads. Step-by-step instructions are provided on how to use VMware Cloud Director (vCD) to create and access VMs running in the VMwaaS virtual data centers (VDCs). Thus far, the experience that was provided in this learning plan was through videos and click-thru demonstrations. A hands-on environment of the VMwaaS instance that was built during the earlier modules is available through an IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment that you can reserve here . LIMITED ACCESS The user access provided to the instance in ITZ is restricted by IBM Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls. Users can view the VMwaaS instances that are already provisioned in the account and deploy a VM and vApp with VMware Cloud Director (vCD). Users cannot provision or modify VMwaaS instances, sites, or virtual data centers. However, even with these restrictions, the environment can be used in performing demonstrations with a \"baking-show\" demonstration approach as an alternative to using the click-thru demos. To learn more about the \"baking-show\" method, check out this article . Note: other ITZ environments are available for IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions that may provide additional access.
